Their arcane talents give them a position of respect within the tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins or Golin'dar are the \"Quick People\" of the gobliniods races. Many view goblins as cowardly backstabbers and bottom feeders living in the lower reaches of cities, not worthy of notice or acknowledgement. The fact of the matter is, the goblins of Eberron are quite different, and noticeably diverse. Some goblins living in cities get along as second class citizens, but many others have callings as spies and scouts in military divisions, mercenary companies, and even secret societies.</p>\n<p>Goblins are people that prefer dark places. Many of them were born in mountains, and they find the most comfort living in caves. Caves, for goblins, are durable and hold up well against attack, giving them a strong means of defense. It is common for goblins to use their small size to their advantage. Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved. They go about their lives with little notice, and try to remain concealed. Goblins of the khesh'dar (Silent Folk) are more confident and assertive in their dealings with others, as a display of their power in their own right.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true},"powerPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"Miracles":{"value":0,"max":0}},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_avfikmynb49","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoids","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary/humanoids/dar/goblin-shaman-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Goblin","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/dar/goblin-shaman-*.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"DUnQ0oGoYxU8CMHt","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"tnYzDolUeDje0DLm","name":"★ Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for their gnoll masters.</p>\n<p>Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_avfikmynb49","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoids","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary/humanoids/gnoll/gnoll-warrior-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gnoll","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/gnoll/warrior-02.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"MvlwqhnnPqGJTsS8","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"g51OdceqBLOvsYIZ","name":"Unskilled Attempt","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","die":{"sides":4,"modifier":"-2"},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nsugutrpau","path":"Skills","color":"#8c160f"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-skills.zcn1epcU4FEJGGyI"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/uncertainty.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LAGjXeGIlviM5MXX","name":"★ Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

It is common for goblins to use their small size to their advantage. Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved.

This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for their gnoll masters.</p>\n<p>Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal.

Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true},"powerPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"Miracles":{"value":0,"max":0}},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_avfikmynb49","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoids","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary/humanoids/gnoll/gnoll-priest-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gnoll Priest","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/gnoll/priest-02.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"W8U9KmHfeZYtRQLh","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"g51OdceqBLOvsYIZ","name":"Unskilled Attempt","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","die":{"sides":4,"modifier":"-2"},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nsugutrpau","path":"Skills","color":"#8c160f"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-skills.zcn1epcU4FEJGGyI"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/uncertainty.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LAGjXeGIlviM5MXX","name":"★ Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.
