Some goblins living in cities get along as second class citizens, but many others have callings as spies and scouts in military divisions, mercenary companies, and even secret societies.</p>\n<p>Goblins are people that prefer dark places.

It is common for goblins to use their small size to their advantage. Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved.

Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved.

Their arcane talents give them a position of respect within the tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins or Golin'dar are the \"Quick People\" of the gobliniods races. Many view goblins as cowardly backstabbers and bottom feeders living in the lower reaches of cities, not worthy of notice or acknowledgement. The fact of the matter is, the goblins of Eberron are quite different, and noticeably diverse. Some goblins living in cities get along as second class citizens, but many others have callings as spies and scouts in military divisions, mercenary companies, and even secret societies.</p>\n<p>Goblins are people that prefer dark places. Many of them were born in mountains, and they find the most comfort living in caves. Caves, for goblins, are durable and hold up well against attack, giving them a strong means of defense. It is common for goblins to use their small size to their advantage. Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved. They go about their lives with little notice, and try to remain concealed. Goblins of the khesh'dar (Silent Folk) are more confident and assertive in their dealings with others, as a display of their power in their own right.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true},"powerPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"Miracles":{"value":0,"max":0}},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ui17eujfrjf","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoids","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary/humanoids/dar/goblin-shaman-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Goblin","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/dar/goblin-shaman-*.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Qn7mwPuPNtLfukhp","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"tnYzDolUeDje0DLm","name":"★ Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

Some goblins living in cities get along as second class citizens, but many others have callings as spies and scouts in military divisions, mercenary companies, and even secret societies.</p>\n<p>Goblins are people that prefer dark places. Many of them were born in mountains, and they find the most comfort living in caves. Caves, for goblins, are durable and hold up well against attack, giving them a strong means of defense. It is common for goblins to use their small size to their advantage. Though this lends people towards cowardice, goblins are pragmatic enough to realize front line combat is a stupid endeavor, so they need every advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>Though they get annoyed by stereotypes, goblins actually have thick skins and care little for others' opinions. They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved.
