Magecraft is the creation of arcane devices as a form of arcane science through an understanding and manipulation of the magic inherent to the world of Eberron. Characters in Eberron with this Arcane Background are referred to as artificers or magewrights.</p>\n<p><em>Magecraft </em>cannot use the <strong>Jury Rig </strong>feature of Weird Science.</p>\n<p>Artificers and magewrights use strange and powerful inventions beyond the normal technological level of the setting. Such creations might be possible due to super fuels, alien discoveries, or the raw intellect of rare super-geniuses who push the boundaries of science.</p>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>Trappings (SWADE page 150) for magecraft must always include the item they're associated with. The burst power might manifest through a rod with the head of a dragon shooting a gout of dragon's breath, while \"Marcomanoi's Wondrous Restorative Elixir!\" is a healing potion.</p>\n<p>Inventors must have their devices at hand to activate their powers.</p>\n<h2>Sharing Creations</h2>\n<p>Other characters can't activate the inventor's creations. They might not understand the strange mechanisms required to make it work, the device might not be \"calibrated\" or portioned for other users, or it might just \"fritz out\" for anyone but the creator. While this may seem a bit strange narratively, the \"magic\"-and the Power Points-come from the inventor so he must be the one to activate it.</p>\n<p>Creating devices for others is possible-it just requires an Arcane Device and the Artificer Edge.</p>\n<p>The inventor can use his devices on others, of course, including administering drinks from his magical elixirs or giving them injections of some miraculous super serum he's created. If Dr. Gabriel administers his elixir, for example, he rolls to activate the power normally. If he gives someone the bottle to use later, they'll find it's lost its potency.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":"Novice"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_ar97r6l0odg","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"BD5tCsxrf88Yo3CC"}

Optionally you may be called to roll on the DragonMark Backlash Table.</p>\n<p><strong>Race and Aberrrant Dragonmarks: </strong>This Arcane Background is only available to dragonmarked races. Races with multiple choices can only ever choose to have one kind of dragonmark. Adventurers with an Aberrant Dragonmark cannot select this Arcane Background as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Rank: </strong>Rank requirements for the Power are ignored when taking this edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Bonus:</strong> The mark also grants a +1 bonus to one skill. Each should be chosen from the options listed along side the dragonmark that manifests.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmarked Heir</h2>\n<p>The adventurer has a dragonmark as appropriate to his race, and is considered a dragonmarked heir. The dragonmark grants the a power from those available to the a particular Mark. In addition a bonus to one skill used by heirs of that dragonmark. The dragonmark grants the ability to use dragonmark focus items and a power granted by that specific mark.</p>\n<p>Each time the adventurer selects the New Power or Power Points Edge for this Arcane Background, the dragonmark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent.</strong> You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Scion. </strong>You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriate. </strong>When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</li>\n<li><strong>Foundling. </strong>Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves and therefore tend to be subtle. Trappings would generally be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. Other types of trappings can be created that should follow along these lines.</p>\n<p><strong>Hands Free:</strong> The bearer of a dragonmark does not need thier hands free to be able to cast their dragonmark power(s).</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmark Abilities and Powers</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Mark</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Race</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Skill Bonus</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Powers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Detection</td>\n<td>Half-elf</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Netowrking (Both Persuasion and Intimidation, see Savage Worlds core rules)</td>\n<td><em>Boost Vigor, darksight, detect/conceal, divination, enviromental protection</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Finding</td>\n<td>Half-orc, human, or orc</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Survival</td>\n<td><em>Analyze foe, detect, farsight, insight, object reading</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Handling</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Animal Handling or Riding rolls</td>\n<td><em>Beast friend, boost Trait (</em>animals only<em>), empathy (</em>animals only<em>), summon beast</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Healing</td>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>+1 to Healing or Survival rolls</td>\n<td>Accelerate healing, boost Vigor, false health, healing, relief</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Hospitality</td>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>+1 to Common KNowledge or Persuasion rolls</td>\n<td><em>Create food and drink, dimensional space, empathy (</em>humanoids only<em>), elemental manipulation (</em>air, fire and water only<em>)</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Making</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Crafting or Repair rolls</td>\n<td><em>Creation, drain power points (</em>arcane devices only<em>), magecraft, repairing</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Passage</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Piloting or Riding rolls</td>\n<td><em>Dimensional space, speed, summon beast (</em>mount only<em>), teleport</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Scribing</td>\n<td>Gnome</td>\n<td>+1 to Lore and Research rolls</td>\n<td><em>Magic mark, message, secret writing, speak language</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Sentinel</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Battle, Fighting, or Shooting rolls</td>\n<td><em>Boost Trait, deflection, gift of battle, protection,&nbsp; warrior's gift</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Shadow</td>\n<td>Elf</td>\n<td>+1 to performance or Stealth rolls</td>\n<td><em>Darkness, disguise, illusion, intangibility, legerdem ain</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Storm</td>\n<td>Half-elf</td>\n<td>+1 to Boating or Piloting rolls</td>\n<td><em>Becalm, elemental manipulation (</em>air and water only<em>), tempest, whirlwind, zephyr</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Warding</td>\n<td>Dwarf</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Thievery rolls</td>\n<td><em>Arcane protection, barrier glyph, lock/unlock, sentry, ward</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":"Novice, Dragonmarked Race"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_ar97r6l0odg","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"nnteRCxpEMryQDWo"}

The owner always sees a bit of himself in his psicrystal, even if magnified and therefore distorted.</p>\n<p><strong>Psicrystal Advancement:</strong> At each Rank of the owner, the psicrystal has the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Novice:</em> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor] +1; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d4</li>\n<li><em>Seasoned: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+2; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d6</li>\n<li><em>Veteran: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+3; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d8</li>\n<li><em>Heroic: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+4; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d10</li>\n<li><em>Legendary: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+5; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d12</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner's choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them.</p>\n<p>Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too, negating the -4 penalty for the destination being an unknown area; the -2 penalty for not being able to see it presently might still apply.</p>\n<p>The psicrystal is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} with respect to Wounds and the Wild Die, but has no Prophecy Shards. The owner may spend his for the psicrystal, however.</p>\n<p>Each additional time this Edge is taken, the psion can pick one of the powers below. Each power may only be taken once. The psion may take this Edge only once each Rank. Taking it during character creation allows the psion to take it again while he's a Novice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The psicrystal gains @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Arcane Resistance]{Arcane Resistance} against psionics.</li>\n<li>The psion can transfer @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} levels to or from his psicrystal as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Actions]{free actions}.</li>\n<li>The psion can use the psicrystal's senses as if they were his own.

They recharge at the same rate as the psion's (usually 1 per hour).</li>\n<li>The psicrystal can act as a conduit for the psion's powers by delivering touch powers manifested by its owner. The owner and the psicrystal must be in contact at the time the power is manifested. The power must be delivered before the owner can manifest another power.

The flesh around an aberrant dragonmark is often covered with welts and boils, and marks related to fire sometimes leave scars or burns on the skin.</p>\n<h2>Aberrant History</h2>\n<p>It usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves. All Aberrant Dragonmarks manifest powers that are destructive and often have that same impact on the user. So trappings might be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. A bolt of fire, might lightly blister the hero around the the mark itself. A boost Trait (Strength) might see the place of the dragonmark on the hero grow in size. Darksight might show black circles around the hero's eyes when active.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Novice"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_ar97r6l0odg","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"wx6oqCl3mHHRR1bj"}
