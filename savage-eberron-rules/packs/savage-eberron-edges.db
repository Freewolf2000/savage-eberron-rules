Each should be chosen from the options listed along side the dragonmark that manifests.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmarked Heir</h2>\n<p>The adventurer has a dragonmark as appropriate to his race, and is considered a dragonmarked heir. The dragonmark grants the a power from those available to the a particular Mark. In addition a bonus to one skill used by heirs of that dragonmark. The dragonmark grants the ability to use dragonmark focus items and a power granted by that specific mark.</p>\n<p>Each time the adventurer selects the New Power or Power Points Edge for this Arcane Background, the dragonmark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent.</strong> You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Scion. </strong>You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriate. </strong>When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</li>\n<li><strong>Foundling. </strong>Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves and therefore tend to be subtle.

The design of the mark is a sinuous pattern of lines, often with a vaguely draconic shape. No two aberrant marks are identical. Certain standard patterns provide hints as to the powers they grant, but two aberrant marks that grant the same power can be wildly divergent in appearance. Aberrant dragonmarks come in a wide range of colors, including oily black, blood red, and vivid green. The flesh around an aberrant dragonmark is often covered with welts and boils, and marks related to fire sometimes leave scars or burns on the skin.</p>\n<h2>Aberrant History</h2>\n<p>It usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves. All Aberrant Dragonmarks manifest powers that are destructive and often have that same impact on the user. So trappings might be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. A bolt of fire, might lightly blister the hero around the the mark itself. A boost Trait (Strength) might see the place of the dragonmark on the hero grow in size. Darksight might show black circles around the hero's eyes when active.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Novice"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_wef7on4nl3m","path":"Savage Eberron#/CF_SEP/Edges#/CF_SEP/Background","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"lNgI5IkJAXFg6hab"}
