Characters with this Edge also have the Outsider (Major) Hindrance, but do not gain additional points.</p>\n<p>Each time the adventurer selects the New Power or Power Points Edge for this Arcane Background, her dragonmark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin and can appear on any part of the body. The design of the mark is a sinuous pattern of lines, often with a vaguely draconic shape. No two aberrant marks are identical. Certain standard patterns provide hints as to the powers they grant, but two aberrant marks that grant the same power can be wildly divergent in appearance. Aberrant dragonmarks come in a wide range of colors, including oily black, blood red, and vivid green. The flesh around an aberrant dragonmark is often covered with welts and boils, and marks related to fire sometimes leave scars or burns on the skin.</p>\n<h2>Aberrant History</h2>\n<p>It usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves. All Aberrant Dragonmarks manifest powers that are destructive and often have that same impact on the user. So trappings might be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. A bolt of fire, might lightly blister the hero around the the mark itself. A boost Trait (Strength) might see the place of the dragonmark on the hero grow in size. Darksight might show black circles around the hero's eyes when active.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Novice"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_nth9juzzfye","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"TZLi9seMbm1aMBJx"}

Consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent.</strong> You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Scion. </strong>You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriate. </strong>When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</li>\n<li><strong>Foundling. </strong>Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trappings</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves and therefore tend to be subtle. Trappings would generally be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. Other types of trappings can be created that should follow along these lines.</p>\n<p><strong>Hands Free:</strong> The bearer of a dragonmark does not need thier hands free to be able to cast their dragonmark power(s).</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmark Abilities and Powers</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Mark</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Race</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Skill Bonus</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Powers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Detection</td>\n<td>Half-elf</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Netowrking (Both Persuasion and Intimidation, see Savage Worlds core rules)</td>\n<td><em>Boost Vigor, darksight, detect/conceal, divination, enviromental protection</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Finding</td>\n<td>Half-orc, human, or orc</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Survival</td>\n<td><em>Analyze foe, detect, farsight, insight, object reading</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Handling</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Animal Handling or Riding rolls</td>\n<td><em>Beast friend, boost Trait (</em>animals only<em>), empathy (</em>animals only<em>), summon beast</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Healing</td>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>+1 to Healing or Survival rolls</td>\n<td>Accelerate healing, boost Vigor, false health, healing, relief</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Hospitality</td>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>+1 to Common KNowledge or Persuasion rolls</td>\n<td><em>Create food and drink, dimensional space, empathy (</em>humanoids only<em>), elemental manipulation (</em>air, fire and water only<em>)</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Making</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Crafting or Repair rolls</td>\n<td><em>Creation, drain power points (</em>arcane devices only<em>), magecraft, repairing</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Passage</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Piloting or Riding rolls</td>\n<td><em>Dimensional space, speed, summon beast (</em>mount only<em>), teleport</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Scribing</td>\n<td>Gnome</td>\n<td>+1 to Lore and Research rolls</td>\n<td><em>Magic mark, message, secret writing, speak language</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Sentinel</td>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>+1 to Battle, Fighting, or Shooting rolls</td>\n<td><em>Boost Trait, deflection, gift of battle, protection,&nbsp; warrior's gift</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Shadow</td>\n<td>Elf</td>\n<td>+1 to performance or Stealth rolls</td>\n<td><em>Darkness, disguise, illusion, intangibility, legerdem ain</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Storm</td>\n<td>Half-elf</td>\n<td>+1 to Boating or Piloting rolls</td>\n<td><em>Becalm, elemental manipulation (</em>air and water only<em>), tempest, whirlwind, zephyr</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mark of Warding</td>\n<td>Dwarf</td>\n<td>+1 to Notice or Thievery rolls</td>\n<td><em>Arcane protection, barrier glyph, lock/unlock, sentry, ward</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":"Novice, Dragonmarked Race"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_nth9juzzfye","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ZOoUAEvz3bGkeW6k"}

If Dr. Gabriel administers his elixir, for example, he rolls to activate the power normally. If he gives someone the bottle to use later, they'll find it's lost its potency.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source: Savage Eberron</strong></em></p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":"Novice"}},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_nth9juzzfye","path":"Edges#/CF_SEP/Background Edges","color":"#000000"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[],"_id":"wLgGbaLP541KdtqR"}
