Upon taking this Edge, its owner typically gets a feel for a psicrystal's personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases gains experience, the psicrystal's personality becomes more pronounced.</p>\n<p>As the owner advances, it is not uncommon for a psicrystal to constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the psicrystal's particular worldview. The owner always sees a bit of himself in his psicrystal, even if magnified and therefore distorted.</p>\n<p><strong>Psicrystal Advancement:</strong> At each Rank of the owner, the psicrystal has the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Novice:</em> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor] +1; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d4</li>\n<li><em>Seasoned: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+2; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d6</li>\n<li><em>Veteran: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+3; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d8</li>\n<li><em>Heroic: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+4; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d10</li>\n<li><em>Legendary: @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]</em>&nbsp;+5; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} d12</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner's choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them.</p>\n<p>Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too, negating the -4 penalty for the destination being an unknown area; the -2 penalty for not being able to see it presently might still apply.</p>\n<p>The psicrystal is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} with respect to Wounds and the Wild Die, but has no Prophecy Shards.

The psion may take this Edge only once each Rank. Taking it during character creation allows the psion to take it again while he's a Novice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The psicrystal gains @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Arcane Resistance]{Arcane Resistance} against psionics.</li>\n<li>The psion can transfer @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} levels to or from his psicrystal as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Actions]{free actions}.</li>\n<li>The psion can use the psicrystal's senses as if they were his own. This requires concentration. The maximum range for this ability is the psion's @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} x 100 yards.</li>\n<li>Whenever the psicrystal is adjacent to or in the possession of its owner, the owner has the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Alertness]{Alertness} Edge.</li>\n<li>Any powers the psion manifests on himself also affect the psicrystal. If he manifests armor with a raise, both he and his psicrystal gain +4 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor] for the duration, for example.</li>\n<li>The psicrystal has 5 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points}, which the psion may use as if they were his own. They recharge at the same rate as the psion's (usually 1 per hour).</li>\n<li>The psicrystal can act as a conduit for the psion's powers by delivering touch powers manifested by its owner. The owner and the psicrystal must be in contact at the time the power is manifested. The power must be delivered before the owner can manifest another power. At @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Legendary} Rank, the owner can manifest the power through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile.</li>\n<li>At @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Seasoned} Rank or above, the owner, as a standard action, can will his psicrystal to fly with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} 6. The effect lasts for one day (or until the owner dismisses it, at which point the psicrystal drifts gently to the ground).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the psicrystal is destroyed, the character must take this Edge again to create a new psicrystal.
