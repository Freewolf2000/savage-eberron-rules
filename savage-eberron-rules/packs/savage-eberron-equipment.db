The king of Breland now issues papers granting adventurers permission to explore and plunder the ruins of Xen'drik. Though such permission is not technically necessary, wise adventurers are sure to secure it before using Sharn as a launching point for expeditions to Xen'drik. Those who try to sell treasures from Xen'drik on the open market in Breland must produce a letter of marque or face stiff fines-on top of forfeiting the treasure they won on their adventures.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":500,"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"isVehicular":false,"mods":1},"flags":{"journal-links":{},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.fzYKihee0ml9dBkF"},"cf":{"id":"temp_l1quzzxujvp","path":"Savage Eberron Equipment#/CF_SEP/Documents & Identification","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/scroll-quill.svg","effects":[]}
