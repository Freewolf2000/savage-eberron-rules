The site of numerous bloody battles, the town would have been abandoned long ago if not for the rich veins of silver and jewels found in the eastern @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Blackcaps]{Blackcaps}. Cragwar serves as the base camp and trading center for dozens of smaller mining villages reaching back into the mountains. Those mines are the single largest source of mithral in western Khorvaire. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak's} influence has kept the town running and even profitable despite the battles to control the area. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} also has a modest guildhall in the village, having always been a major buyer of rare metals to stock its forges.</p>\n<p>In addition to the monsters that come down out of the mountains or up from the depths of Khyber through the mines, the lives of ordinary citizens are sometimes threatened by the machinations of the Aurum. Two members of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aurum]{Aurum's} gold concord make their home in Cragwar—<span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Daeluse d'Kundarak</em></span> (LE female dwarf aristocrat 3/rogue 2/dragonmark heir 4) ensures the safety of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aurum]{Aurum's} interests in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Blackcaps]{Blackcaps}, and the steady flow of money into their coffers. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zeed</em></span> (NE male changeling rogue 2/sorcerer 4/master inquisitive 2) runs the town's limited underworld, and acts as an information broker and arms dealer.

Zeed's activities have also attracted the attention of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.King's Citadel]{King's Citadel}, which is currently considering sending in new agents or even a few trusted outsiders who would be unknown to Zeed and his minions.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

However, the path you take to claim that power is very much up to you.</p>\n<p>As a scion of the house, you might choose to be a socialite, taking pride in your house's works and enjoying the fame that goes with them. As an adventurer, you likely seek inspiration for some epic work you have in mind. Performance is in your blood, though, and between adventures you are never far from the theater, the tavern, or any other place where you can regale friends and strangers with story or song.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/phiarlan-illusionist.webp\" width=\"318\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose the path of the agent, you serve the will of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}. Though some who know of Phiarlan's intelligence services might call you thief or spy, you know better. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} chooses each assignment with care, and through your work in the shadows, you shape the future.</p>\n<p>A third path is that of the nomad. You respect the traditions and methods of your house and wish to hold influence within it, but you have no intention of working your way up through standard service. Instead, you create your own power base, starting with the members of your adventuring party. You will weave your own web of influence, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} will accept you as an equal in the end.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} has few enemies. Barring occasional duels between heirs who have crossed each other, your family's rivalry with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} remains a subtle war. Both houses respect the potential damage each could inflict on the other, and respect their established territories.</p>\n<p>When members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} do engage in combat, they do so carefully and methodically. You study your enemy beforehand, learning his weaknesses and preferred tactics. Whenever possible, you choose the battlefield, picking ground that provides a tactical or psychological advantage.</p>\n<p>From the four-thousand-year history of your house, you know patience. A Phiarlan assassin might wait a month to prepare the definitive situation in which to strike, and like those cold killers of your house, you do not consider honor to be a virtue in battle. It is always best to avoid combat when possible, but when you are forced into it, surprise your foe. Exploit his weaknesses. Do whatever it takes to win.</p>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<h2>Heirloom Performances</h2>\n<p>While @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} long ago severed its ties to the Undying Court, members of the house still hold their history and the memories of their ancestors in high regard. The greatest treasures of the house are the works of ancient artists: the dance with which Jhazalaen Elorrenthi blinded the King of Fire, the song that Maenol sang as the elves boarded their ships in Xen'drik, and other epic performances. One of the greatest honors any elf can receive is the right to perform one of these heirloom works. Each is incredibly hard to master, and requires intensive training and the study of ancient tomes. Traditionally, the bearer of an heirloom performance chooses his successor, but should he die without designating an heir, the council of the appropriate house demesne selects a new elf to perform the art. Stories circulate of unworthy heirs assassinated by demesne councils in order for an heirloom performance to be transferred to a superior artist, but these have never been substantiated.</p>\n<p>An elf known to be the rightful enactor of an heirloom performance receives a +2 bonus on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} checks involving members of his dragonmarked house. Teaching an heirloom performance to an unworthy pupil is a terrible crime, and both master and student could face censure or worse.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>In the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, talent rises to the top. Skill in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} and an aptitude for magic are the pillars of a career with the guild, but it takes more than a single performance to earn the top spot in a theatrical company. Repeated success is necessary in order for the house to invest resources in promoting you. As an adventuring entertainer, your life might not put you on the fast track to house leadership, but you could seek the right to carry one of the heirloom performances of the house (see the sidebar).</p>\n<p>The life of an entertainer easily suits a bard, but other adventurers are more likely to be drawn to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}. Children of the house play games of intrigue and deception, and the lessons of your youth remain with you. As you undertake missions for the house, you receive ongoing training in the silent arts. Beyond this, the house can provide you with insight into the secret struggles taking place in the shadows across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, you are taught to be ruthless and expedient when a mission requires it. You are trained to search for the secrets in any situation, since any piece of knowledge might someday prove valuable.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>Should you serve the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, your adventuring companions are seen by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} as an extension of you—a tool you are expected to mold and use for the benefit of the house. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} excels at magical surveillance, and you will never undertake a mission that could be accomplished by the simple use of scrying. As a low-level agent, you might be sent on so-called shadowbait missions, following a target or penetrating an unexplored location to serve as an anchor for magical observation. If you are especially talented, you might be sent to steal a lock of hair from a target the house wishes to spy upon, or to plant a shadow eye. Missions in the service of the house and its clients could set you against kings, dragonmarked viceroys, masterminds of the Aurum, or even the Lords of Dust.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} has no special dispensation to break the law, and agents captured while engaged in illegal activities suffer the consequences. Serpentine liaisons require full disclosure about the reasons driving an assignment. Assassination requires excellent justification, and the house never kills or kidnaps a client in good standing—one of the reasons rulers prefer to work with the house instead of against it.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Organizations in House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan as an Organization]{House Phiarlan as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{People of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Spirit Keepers]{Spirit Keepers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan in the World]{House Phiarlan in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Phiarlan]{Playing a Member of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_v6ohxlugu8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Communication is the cord that binds civilization together, and your ancestors have settled the disputes of kings and helped the dragonmarked houses find a place in the world. Few people realize the influence @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} has had on the shape of the modern age, just as few know how often a royal advisor holds more power than the king himself. Let @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith} and the others fight for fame and recognition. You know that the greatest work is done in silence.</p>\n<p>Your upbringing has taught you to see life as an extended game. As an adventurer, you might be playing a long game, building influence only usable in years to come. On the other hand, you might simply enjoy the challenge of the moment, and the thrill of pitting your wits against the world as you unravel the most difficult puzzles. Your family has always found a way to cut through chaos and produce order, and you endeavor to do the same. Never reveal your full strength or your true goals. Always watch for ways to gain an advantage over your enemies.</p>\n<p>Of course, not every member of your house follows these traditions. A number of excoriates in the annals of Sivis have taken joy in causing chaos and confusion, and this dark path might call to you more than you care to admit.</p>\n<p>For those in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}, the connection to the sea is always strong. </p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>“Five words can defeat a thousand swords” is a Zil proverb that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} lives by. For an heir of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, the challenge is to prevent combat. This does not mean that you back down from a fight, but where diplomacy fails, bribery, intimidation, enchantment, or blackmail are all tools that can be brought into play. When combat is unavoidable, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} primarily relies on the services of House Kundarak for magical and physical security; when personally drawn into battle, you likewise look to your allies. Like most Sivis heirs, you prefer magic to steel's lack of subtlety. As such, Sivis experts, rogues, and bards often maximize their effectiveness with Use Magic Device.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer, you jump into melee more often than your house kin, but you always keep your eyes open for ways to resolve conflict without combat. When battle is joined, try to be clever and expedient. Look for weaknesses to exploit, and ways to bring combat to a close as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Life within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} is a constant struggle for rank and prestige. The house uses a system of titles and offices far more complicated than any other house. Some of these are tied to specific vocations, but others are simply honorifics passed from heir to heir. Within even the smallest message station, heirs compete for the position of Prime Stonekeeper, while hirelings might also fight for the title of Keeper of the Fifteenth Word.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, this competition does not affect the operations of the house. It is a complex but highly civilized game—a form of entertainment, intended to keep an heir's mind sharp. You face off against your fellows, but never to the extent of hurting them or threatening the stability of the house. Someone always wins, and someone always loses, but you can always set up the pieces for another game.</p>\n<p>Though life as an adventurer removes you from the daily struggles of the workplace, any mission you undertake presents you with an opportunity to earn a new title or improve your standing in the house. At the same time, always be watchful for others seeking to steal your victories and claim your titles as their own. As an agent of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, your most prevalent enemies might well be other agents of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, especially those of different bloodlines. Such familial foes never act to threaten the interests of the house, but if they can do the job better than you, they will.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer, you are in an excellent position to acquire information, whether the secrets of fallen empires or contemporary lore never seen by gnome eyes. There is nothing wrong with gold, but the greatest treasure of all is knowledge. As your adventures take you through the world, look for the wealth that others miss.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} does not seek to enforce its will on the world—at least not openly. As an agent of the house, gathering information is your most important duty. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} seeks to maintain order among the dragonmarked houses. As such, you might be assigned to investigate the actions of another house or to resolve an ongoing conflict, either openly or through subtle action. The house always searches for ways to improve communication, including research into magic, psionics, and forgotten languages. While a Cannith expedition to Xen'drik covets lost schemas, you might tag along in search of an ancient tome on semantics.</p>\n<p>House Sivis also has a great interest in the draconic Prophecy, particularly the dragonmarks that appear in the world at large. These symbols hold the key to the future, and if any mortals can unlock their significance, the masters of the Mark of Scribing will be the ones to do so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Organizations in House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{People of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis as an Organization]{House Sivis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis in the World]{House Sivis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Sivis]{Playing a Member of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Impartial Voice]{The Impartial Voice}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-sivis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_k6d9algq2g","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

The blink dog seal of the house is a beacon for the weary traveler. When stamped on the trade sign of an inn or tavern, it promises reliable service and reasonable rates—but there might be more to this simple inn than meets the eye. House Ghallanda goes to great lengths to form bonds within local communities, and Ghallanda heirs take pride in being able to acquire special services for valued clients. The Ghallanda innkeeper is not a spy, nor does he solve crimes. He knows the word on the street, though, and if you're looking for tickets to the Sharn Opera, a discreet bordello, or a trustworthy diviner, he can help you.</p>\n<p>Though Ghallanda is known for its inns, the house has other holdings. Ghallanda landlords offer longterm housing, and the master chefs of the house prepare meals for kings and queens.

Those who manifested the mark tended to congregate together and eventually took the name Ghallanda, meaning “helpful hounds.” Moving from oasis to outpost across eastern Khorvaire, the Ghallandas offered food and shelter to any fellow travelers, and they were instrumental in quelling feuds, monster depredations, and other local concerns at each stop.</p>\n<p>When Karrn the Conqueror explored the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}, the other dragon marked houses discovered the Ghallandas. After countless hours at the bargaining table, the other houses recognized the Ghallandas as a full-fledged house, and House Ghallanda started spreading across Khorvaire, first establishing inns and taverns and then constructing enclaves from the Barren Sea to the Lhazaar Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> When @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} mercenaries marched into battle early in the Last War, they had a contingent from House Ghallanda marching with them to provide food and shelter in the field. Other armies noticed how useful the magical creations of the Ghallandas were, and eventually all sides were hiring House Ghallanda to furnish provisions and supplies for their rear echelons. In the chaos of war, House Ghallanda sometimes found itself on the front lines, and its promises to remain a noncombatant weren't always kept. As a result, House Ghallanda has more than a few capable veteran soldiers among its ranks today.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{Baron Yoren d'Ghallanda}: </strong>The baron of House Ghallanda has delegated daily operations, spending much of his time on diplomatic missions for the house.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{Chervina d'Ghallanda the Architect}: </strong>A powerful wizard that guides Yorne on places to offer hospitality.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{Keslo d'Ghallanda}: </strong>The viceroy in charge of Ghallanda Hall in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Gatherhold:</strong> A great stronghold on the eastern shore of Lake Cyre, the cliff dwellings of Gatherhold are the jumping-off point for many an adventure in eastern Khorvaire.

{"_id":"0j5LH4DoO9n5A9n6","name":"The Hideaway","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Hideaway</h1>\n<p>This establishment can best be described as a high-class watering hole. The Hideaway makes most of its money from travelers staying in the tower, but the city's residents frequent it as well. It has a convenient location—on the same floor as a skybridge and only about 100 feet from it—and is a favorite destination for those wishing to get away from their usual routines. ​</p>\n<h3>Profile</h3>\n<p>​The Hideaway's entire floor is covered with a thick, gray rug. The dark-stained wooden tables are sturdy yet elegant and built to seat either three or eight. The chairs have high backs and cushioned seats upholstered with a cream-colored fabric. </p>\n<p>Many regulars consider imbibing alcohol to be the best entertainment available here, but the customers enjoy socializing as well. Because people are encouraged to mingle, boasting about adventures, genealogy, or businesses is common. Embellishment of the truth also occurs frequently, and many of the rumors floating around Sharn get their starts here. Occasionally patrons engage in drinking games or other activities that lead to later embarrassment. </p>\n<p>Music and dancing are available for those who seek greater diversions than their comrades can provide. Sizable bands play here twice a week and during holidays, as well as on certain special occasions. When musicians are present, the tables that normally fill the front room are moved to the side to provide space for dancing. ​</p>\n<h3>Boromar Clan</h3>\n<p>​The Hideaway is truer to its name than many would imagine. It is owned by Guillome Boromar, one of Sharn's most successful crime lords. Guillome normally maintains a subdued presence here, content to sip wine and watch others entertain themselves, although he occasionally calls attention to famous guests or good friends. On occasion, however, he arranges meetings here with fences, assassins, and other criminal associates. These rogues hold conversations in the open, but out of earshot of the other patrons. </p>\n<p>The Hideaway also provides a convenient way for Guillome to launder his money. Though it is true that his clan keeps the city guard paid off, Guillome still has enemies, some of whom would do anything bring him down. Guillome knows that if the flow of money into his coffers could be traced back to some illicit enterprise, he would have a difficult time avoiding justice, so he uses the Hideaway to account for the money he brings in. In fact, despite the popularity of this place, Guillome actually loses a small amount of money on it each month due to the rent he pays, the expensive drinks he imports, and the other costs that he must absorb. Even so, however, it is worth the investment because it shields him from the liabilities he would otherwise face. ​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6i6olmfjt1f","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The Medani families banded together in preGalifar @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} prior to that conflict, but had few aspirations beyond being left alone. Only in the aftermath of the War of the Mark did Medani's elders bow to the pressure of the other houses and take their place among the dragonmarked.</p>\n<p>Despite often strained relations with the other houses, Medani's collective voice carries weight.

Members of the house were so effective at using their power quietly that the other houses initially thought they were bearing an aberrant mark when @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} discovered them in the middle of the War of the Mark. Because House Medani had no aspirations beyond a few provinces in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, it took a great deal of negotiation—and not a few veiled threats—to persuade it to join the other dragonmarked houses.</p>\n<p>Even after formally becoming a dragon marked house, the Medanis remained at arm's length from the politics of the other houses. Many call them aloof or inscrutable, and the other dragon marked houses question whether House Medani is closer to the Brelish crown than it is to the other houses. The distance between House Medani and the other houses is the result of more than suspicions over Brelish influence, however. Fundamentally, a house that notices everything, apprehends spies (many @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlans} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thurannis} among them), and keeps its secrets to itself is a house that's bound to make everyone else nervous.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> The other houses' suspicions about House Medani's connections to the crown of Breland have some merit. As the Last War raged on, House Medani increasingly became the counterintelligence arm of the Brelish government. Although the house didn't engage in espionage directly, it did apprehend dozens of spies from other nations and power groups, and it performed a lot of investigative law enforcement while most able-bodied watchmen and guards were off at war. That connection between house and crown survived the war intact, and House Medani has a subtle but pervasive influence on the Brelish king.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Medani]{Baron Trelib d'Medani}: </strong>Patriarch of House Medani and longtime friend of King Boranel.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Tower of Inquisition:</strong> A blocky stone tower in Wroat midway between Brokenblade Castle (King Boranel's palace) and Parliament Hall, the Tower of Inquisition is used for the interrogation of prisoners apprehended by House Medani or by King Boranel's agents.

You know the legends of your house and people as well as you know your own name, but threading through all those legends is the sense of worth that marks what it means to be a Kundarak. You are a role model among your people—a member of a clan that never claimed a crown yet has always managed to quietly lead.</p>\n<p>Within the clans, some mistake your confidence for bravado, but you accept their jealousy for what it is. Outside the clans, you are typically shown the respect—or outright awe—that the position of your house demands. Though some speak in dark whispers of Kundarak as profiteers and hoarders of wealth, you dismiss them easily enough. For in the end, only those who have earned the respect of the Kundarak are worth your worry.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>A member of a house of warders and protectors, you look upon unprovoked aggression with disdain. For long years, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} watched an endless cycle of reprisals decimate its people, and its stomach for barbarism is long gone. Savagery is for savages, not for dwarves of honor. At the same time, your sense of honor means that you rarely back down from a fight—or at least from a worthy fight. When attacked, you are steadfast in your resolve and more than capable of standing your ground. As a Kundarak, you are fiercest when defending the lives, homes, or honor of those close to you.</p>\n<p>Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} would never sully its reputation for even-handed professionalism, individual adventurers within the house also enjoy honorable combat. If you are one of these, your regular tales of heroic exploits are bound to make you the envy of your fellows.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>An established hierarchy is essential for the smooth operation of house affairs, but Kundarak dwarves find little use for excessive bureaucracy or organization. Where other houses focus on advancement through the acquisition of individual rank and wealth, the heirs of Kundarak only promote the advancement of honor. Amassing great fortune and respect while climbing the ranks of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Banking Guild} is desirable because increased wealth and the esteem of others translates to honor for the house at large. Wealth is not, however, an end in itself. Should you dishonor your house, no amount of money will ameliorate your shame.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer, you have a higher profile (and are held to higher standards) than other house members. Although success in adventuring can earn you both wealth and respect, you are careful to not let your personal exploits overshadow the house you serve.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} maintains its neutrality (and thus its reputation) by providing goods and services when called upon to do so, not by indiscriminately glorifying its talents. As an agent of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, you undertake tasks that ultimately improve the honor of your house. If your talents lie in crafting iron, that is how you best serve; if seeking out and silencing Kundarak's enemies is your strong suit, then that you will do.</p>\n<p>One matter on which @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} brooks no internal dissent is the subject of order among the dragonmarked. Having learned from the endless clan wars and the more recent destruction during the War of the Mark, you are determined to diminish conflict between the houses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Organizations in House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{People of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak as an Organization]{House Kundarak as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak in the World]{House Kundarak in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Kundarak]{Playing a Member of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wardens of the Gates]{Wardens of the Gates}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-kundarak-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_cx94dsdsky8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

She is reckless rage and all-consuming passion. Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Devourer]{the Devourer} embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.</p>\n<p>Devotees of the Fury generally follow one of two paths. Revelers believe that suppressing emotion causes anguish, and that people should embrace their emotions fully and act on impulse and instinct. They hold wild, ecstatic celebrations as a way for participants to throw off the chains of civilization for a moment and experience life and emotion fully. A player character who follows this path might be a Berserker barbarian or a bard using the College of Glamour—either embracing their own primal emotion or inspiring it in others. A sorcerer might attribute their power to wild emotion; they can only access their magic when they let the Fury guide them.</p>\n<p>The other path of the Fury is the road of revenge. People who have suffered grievously can call on the Fury to give them the will and strength to take vengeance into their own hands. Or rather than seeking revenge themselves, one tradition calls for someone who has been wronged to place a red candle in a window, inscribed with the name of their tormentor. This is an invitation for the Fury to take vengeance on their behalf. A player character following this path could be charged to investigate and fulfill these calls for revenge.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Passion, revenge, anger, insanity</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Winged wyrm with woman's head and arms</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Two-handed sword</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> In all matters, the Fury’s priests are passionate.

The bucolic lifestyle that most house members lead keeps them tied to the cycles of nature, instilling a patience that few outside a farming community ever know.</p>\n<p>Vadalis is flexible when it comes to the career preferences of its members.

Warriors and fighters often become teamsters, driving caravans for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} or providing security at house enclaves or on the road. Rangers support the care and training of animals for Vadalis clients, and travel unexplored lands to seek out new specimens, retrieve lost animals, or act as couriers in areas too remote for Orien to serve. Druids work to protect the land and safeguard the policies and processes of the house. They act as an ethical compass for the family, and are central to the magical research needed to develop and improve existing breeding programs.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE VADALIS BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis'} investments and holdings are primarily centered in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, with minor enclaves and outposts spread across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} offers a 25% discount on the purchase of its magebred animals to house members, and a 50% discount on stabling and related services.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} gives free use of pack and riding animals (horses, mules, oxen, and so on) and related gear to house members, as long as the animals are well tended.

It was a hard land, but they endured—and two centuries later, the Mark of Handling appeared on their children. This event was seen as a gift from the Sovereign Host, a way to help the Vadalis families survive and prosper in the hard lands.</p>\n<p>Today House Vadalis is seen as fairly benevolent, but there are dark secrets in its past. The Seryan line of the house has always been interested in the dark power of the natural world. While others focused on breeding better livestock, the Seryans studied the displacer beast and the dire wolf. Their research came to the fore during the War of the Mark. House Vadalis takes bloodlines seriously, and it was quick to join the other houses in the effort to eliminate bearers of aberrant dragon marks.</p>\n<p>During that war, the Seryans revealed the fruits of their labors: horrific living weapons. Much of their work was so terrible that records of it have been suppressed. Following the war, their creations were destroyed and their practices outlawed by the new Council of the Twelve.</p>\n<p>Following the War of the Mark, the heirs of House Vadalis settled into their work, breeding mounts and livestock and wandering the world. House Vadalis has never been one of the most powerful or profitable houses, and it has never tried to be. The Vadalis heirs are a family, and they do what they love.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> The Last War was good for house business. House Vadalis produced magebred bears for the Brelish special forces, dragonhawks for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, and all manner of mounts and warbeasts. It was during the war that the organization known as the Feral Heart rose within the house—a group that sought to re-create and improve upon the forbidden techniques of the Seryan line, including the practice of magebreeding humans.</p>\n<p>During the Last War, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} seceded from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Even though its seat of power lay within the newly independent @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, House Vadalis remained neutral in this struggle and still takes no side in the clash between the two nations.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the war, the hunters of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Balinor]{Balinor's} Blessed ignited a bitter feud between House Vadalis and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} elves when they sought to steal a herd of Valenar horses. House Vadalis is fascinated by these animals, and is always interested in acquiring a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} steed; however, to date it has not managed to breed one of the fey horses.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{Dalin d'Vadalis}: </strong>Current leader of House Vadalis, a friendly man with a good heart.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{Mazina d'Vadalis}: </strong>Chief magebreeder of the Feral Heart.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{Sasik d'Vadalis}: </strong>Consort to Queen Aurala of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}.

Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Dura]{Lower Dura}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Central]{Upper Central}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Menthis]{Middle Menthis}.</p>\n<p>Upper wards are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma checks).</p>\n<p>Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.</p>\n<p>Middle wards are home to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.</p>\n<p>Lower wards house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a haven for criminals and gangs.</p>\n<p>These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura} is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Dura]{Upper Dura} is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, because @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau} is a hub of wealth and power, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Central]{Lower Central} is effectively a middle ward.</p>\n<p>Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Northedge]{Lower Northedge} includes the districts of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stoneyard]{Stoneyard}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Longstairs]{Longstairs}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.North Market]{North Market}. It's generally true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Central]{Upper Central} will typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Dura]{Lower Dura} will be squalid and dangerous.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/maps/sharn/sharn-vertical-map.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ggzl5wksbsl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

But while the maps reflected this claim, few Brelish lived in the western barrens beyond the Graywall Mountains. The place has always been dangerous, a haven for monsters of all sorts, and the land was never easy to work or hunt. A few brave settlers tried to tame the land over the years, but none of them ever met with much luck. As the Last War wore on, monster warbands became more aggressive, striking at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} either at the behest of warring nations or for their own spoils of war. In 987 YK, King Boranel of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} evacuated the few remaining Brelish and declared that the land west of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} was sealed and off limits. In that same year, a trio of hags declared the sovereignty of the new nation of Droaam.</p>\n<p>In addition to hosting aggressive tribes of goblins, ogres, and Khorvaire’s largest gnoll population, the region has long been home to a wide variety of dangerous monsters—both natural beasts and strange creatures formed from dark magic. Aside from a few fertile valleys, the region is rocky and inhospitable; while glory-seeking knights often ventured into the barrens in search of adventure, no ruler of Breland ever considered the full conquest of the area to be worth the effort. For their part, the various monsters of the region never developed the organization or leadership required to threaten the eastern domain. Instead ogre and troll fought one another, pausing only to crush the occasional questing knight. And so throughout the history of Breland, the barrens were a place of dark legend. Mothers would threaten to send bad children to the barrens to be eaten by monsters, but otherwise few people thought much about the creatures lurking to the west.</p>\n<p>The Last War did not go unnoticed by the monstrous inhabitants of the barrens. As Breland’s forces were depleted and diverted to the front lines, monsters began to venture into the lowlands, raiding villages or striking travelers and fading back into the barrens. But these actions were uncoordinated attacks with no long-term goals or effects, since no central authority could exert influence over the various creatures of the land. Other warring nations occasionally sent scouts into the barrens to rile up the monsters or hire monstrous warbands to strike at Breland. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] was particularly good at convincing monster warlords who ruled various parts of the barrens to descend upon and pillage the lowland settlements.</p>\n<p>The turning point for the region came in 986 YK with the arrival of a trio of powerful hags, the Daughters of Sora Kell—Katra, Maenya, and Teraza. These crones were already legends. The green hag Sora Katra had haunted the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} for generations, while the annis Sora Maenya had terrorized the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches][Eldeen Reaches} and the dusk hag Sora Teraza romed the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Demon Wastes][Demon Wastes} in search of ancient knowledge. The hags had prepared for many years to claim a land for their own, and they arrived in the barrens with an army of fanatical gnolls, ogres, and trolls. The sisters and their minions established themselves in the ancient ruins at the base of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag}. Over the course of the following year, the hags established their power through force of arms, destroying or scattering humanoid tribes and the domains of lesser warlords. After a sufficient numbers of examples had been made, the sisters called for the remaining powers of the region to present themselves at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag}. There, the hags declared the foundation of the nation of Droaam—a haven for all the creatures feared and shunned by the common races.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months, Sora Katra established the basic system of tribute that passes for government in Droaam. Since then the hags have been rebuilding the court at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag} and slowly establishing contact with the outside world. (They petitioned, unsuccessfully, to be included in the talks that led to the Thronehold Accords, and thus the nation remains unrecognized by the rest of Khorvaire.) While Katra’s charisma is undeniable, the long-term goals of the green hag and her sisters remain a mystery.</p>\n<h2>AFTERMATH OF THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>Droaam is barely a decade old. The treaty nations refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty; according to the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, it's a rebellious territory of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. As a renegade nation, it is a haven for war criminals and deserters, as well as brigands and mages pursuing forbidden paths of magic. The monsters of Droaam have no particular love for these bandits and fugitives, and outlanders have to watch their step.</p>\n<p>Tensions remain high on the border with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, resulting in constant skirmishes and raids. Deeper within the nation, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} build their power. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag} are constantly expanding, with goblins and ogres laboring through the night. Warlords drill their troops, forcing all manner of monsters to work together. A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness. For centuries the people of Droaam have hidden in the shadows; now they stand in the light, and they are proud.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"1juPorgj9HX3NtSY","name":"Syrania","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Syrania</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Azure Sky</h2>\n<p>Imagine a perfect blue sky, stretching off into the horizon. There’s no sign of the sun, but the sky is clear and bright, and the floating crystal towers gleam as if caught in a sunbeam. A warm, gentle breeze brushes over you, and there’s a faint sound of distant chimes. You feel absolutely calm; in this moment, all anger melts away.</p>\n<p>This is Syrania, the Azure Sky. While people often think of its floating towers and crystal spires—the same magic that sustains the great towers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}— Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in peaceful times: commerce, education, reflection. There are no vast armies here, no dangerous monsters. The magic of Syrania allows all creatures to communicate and dispels aggression. As such, it’s a common crossroads for beings who do travel the planes, and the Immeasurable Market of Syrania is the safest place to interact with fiends, slaadi, and other extraplanar beings. However, while bloodshed is rare in the Azure Sky, you can still make deadly enemies; mortals are always wise to tread lightly in the cities of angels.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Syrania encourages communication and negotiation, and grants all creatures the gift of flight. The Open Sky of Syrania is an endless void, and without flight, you could fall indefinitely; fortunately, all creatures find that they can move through the air just as naturally as walking.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/syrania-symbol.webp\" width=\"291\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Unburdened.</strong> A creature gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, unless it already has a flying speed greater than or equal to its walking speed, in which case that speed increases by 10 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Gentle Thoughts.</strong> A creature has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Time.</strong> Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.</p>\n<p><strong>Universal Understanding. </strong>A creature can understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that it hears and can understand any written language that it can see. This doesn’t decode secret messages or reveal the meaning of symbols that aren’t part of a written language.</p>\n<p><strong>Absolute Peace. </strong>To make an attack or cast a damaging spell, a creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it doesn’t make the attack or cast the spell, but the action is lost.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are some ways that Syrania affects the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Syrania can reflect one or more of the properties of the plane, but often in more limited ways. The manifest zone containing the city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} has a lesser aspect of the Unburdened property; it doesn’t grant flight, but it enhances effects that grant flight or levitation, enabling the skycoaches and flying buttresses that support the towers. A zone that has the Absolute Peace property might have a lower DC for the saving throw, or it might encourage peaceful behavior without actively enforcing it. Temples are often built on Syranian zones with the Absolute Peace property, while universities and House Sivis search for zones with the Universal Understanding property.</p>\n<p>In addition to standard manifest zones, there are a few portals to the Immeasurable Market hidden in Eberron. These take many forms; a back door could be an actual door, a large chest, or a shallow pool of water. A back door only opens under specific circumstances: when opened with a special key, when used at a certain time, when blood is spilled, or when a heart is broken. Most who discover these portals jealously guard them; a merchant with access to the Immeasurable Market can acquire remarkable goods!</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>When Syrania is coterminous, goodwill spreads across the world and people find it nearly impossible to contemplate violence. These periods brought welcome moments of peace during the Last War, and there are stories of enemy soldiers coming together to share stories or play games. During these times, the Absolute Peace and Gentle Thoughts properties apply across Eberron. However, if a creature is attacked, harmed by a spell, or witnesses its friends being harmed, that creature is unaffected by Absolute Peace for one minute. The influence of Syrania limits violence, but once conflicts break out, it can’t stop them.</p>\n<p>While Syrania is coterminous, the skies are clear and the weather is calm—it’s believed that if you’re in a Syranian manifest zone during this time, it’s possible to fly into the Open Sky simply by flying straight up to the edge of the sky. This may be apocryphal or only true in certain manifest zones . . . there’s only one way to find out!</p>\n<p>When Syrania is remote, the skies are gray and the sun can’t be seen. People feel quarrelsome and it’s difficult to come to an understanding. Creatures have disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Outside of Syranian manifest zones, all flying speeds are reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Syrania is coterminous on the 9th day of the month of Rhaan, once every ten years. Followers of the Sovereign Host celebrate this day every year as Boldrei’s Feast, a time for people to come together and resolve their grievances; the tenth-year coterminous celebrations are especially grand. Syrania is remote once every ten years on the same day, five years after the coterminous period. This day is still celebrated, as people make a conscious effort not to give into anger.</p>\n<h3>syranian artifaCts</h3>\n<p>Syrania’s greatest treasure is the Immeasurable Market itself, with all manner of exotic goods available there. Many of the dominions of Syrania are more interested in collecting relics tied to their domain than in creating them, but there are a few who do both; the limits of what they can produce are tied to their domain.</p>\n<p>Other Syranian items are usually linked to the plane’s universal properties. The power of Syrania enhances flight; there’s a stall in the Market that sells wings of flying that resemble the wings of an angel. Things that encourage or enforce peace may come from Syrania, along with items that enhance a character’s diplomatic ability</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/syrania-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_2l7m835ydxg","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

Doldarun soldiers have always been among the best-trained and mostdisciplined warriors among the dwarves, and they’re the most inclined to place their lives at risk for the good of all. There are countless tales of Doldarun facing terrifying monsters, fiends, and undead; if you need an exorcist in the Mror Holds, Doldarunhold is your best bet.</p>\n<p>Doldarun suffered heavy losses in the War Below; in part because it was the clan most determined to win the war instead of accepting the current stalemate, many Doldarun soldiers died in bold strikes against the foul enemy. The clan maintains a garrisoned colony below Silverblade Keep, and is building strength for a new offensive. In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold. Clan Doldarun has an ancient feud with Clan Soldorak, and denounced Narathun twenty years ago over Narathun fleshcrafting.</p>\n<p>Doldarun characters are likely to be acolytes or soldiers. This is an excellent clan for clerics, fighters, or paladins—especially War clerics and Oath of Devotion paladins. Rarely, perhaps once in a generation, the line of Doldarun produces dwarven Host aasimar.

You understand the culture of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} (as least as well as you want to), but are not drawn into the games of ambition and status others play. You know the beauty and power inherent in life, the mysteries of birth and death, and the miracles that happen in between. Those divorced from the land might offer scorn and ridicule at your lack of supposed sophistication, but your world holds far more truth than those who inhabit the cities will ever know.</p>\n<p>The modern age is a tangled web of plots and plans, but the forces of nature are stronger than the machinations of people.

Regardless of the affectations people choose to give it, combat is not a game. You fight when you must and you fight to win, but you are never afraid to walk away from a fight if you have the option.</p>\n<p>Aside from the lives and well-being of those you care about, few things are worth dying for.

The house might arrange instruction for you if you pursue an outside vocation, but you must pay your own way. Dragonmarked heirs are expected to continue using their marks for house business even if their main career takes them far from house and birth.

Not all Vadalis missions will keep you on the frontier, though, and you might accompany @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{Orien} caravans to any corner of Khorvaire, or act as handler for rare magebred creatures in the nightclubs of Sharn.</p>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} typically play a support role in combat, since their abilities are often secondary to those of the animals they command.

It seems clear that Gath has similar feelings, if he can be said to feel, or else Gaia would certainly not be alive.​​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_vohphnvcq2k","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"3NOUDsEP0iQ9cQsk","name":"Dal Quor","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Dal Quor</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Region of Dreams</h2>\n<p>Dal Quor is both impossibly distant and remarkably close. Tens of thousands of years ago, the giants of Xen’drik shattered the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. Since then, it’s been permanently remote, and no naturally occurring manifest zone to Dal Quor has been discovered. Not even plane shift or astral travel can allow direct contact with the Region of Dreams. And yet, it’s also the closest of the planes—to visit, just close your eyes. Dreaming is a form of spiritual travel, as your mortal consciousness is drawn to Dal Quor.</p>\n<p>Dal Quor is the realm of dreams, a place of imagination where memory and emotion can shape reality. The stories of Thelanis bring people together in a shared tale; by contrast, the dreams of Dal Quor are unique, individual, and fleeting. They’re defined by our experiences and desires, and we rarely remember them when they’re over. Dreams allows us to sift through our subconscious, and they are ours alone—or at least, they should be . . . if they aren’t manipulated by an outside force. The denizens of Dal Quor reflect the secondary theme of the plane, and—for now, at least—that theme is nightmares. The quori prey on mortal dreams, twisting them to produce the emotions they crave. This doesn’t mean all dreams are nightmares—but when a quori takes an interest in your dream, it’ll usually become one.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself. Even when you’re exploring someone else’s dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape. The Shifting Dreams table provides ideas for how a dream could change.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/dal-quor-symbol.webp\" width=\"255\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Extremely Morphic. </strong>The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DM’s discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature’s dream that they’re currently experiencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Extended Illusion. </strong>When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Flowing Time.</strong> For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Ever since the Age of Giants, it’s been nearly impossible to physically interact with Dal Quor from the Material Plane. This forces the quori tied to the kalashtar and the Inspired to act through mortal agents. The only denizens of Dal Quor that can easily enter the world are the fey of the Fading Dream. The plane is always remote; undoing this damage would be an epic quest, potentially returning the thirteenth moon to the sky. But even at a distance, Dal Quor can affect the waking world.</p>\n<h3>DreaMs</h3>\n<p>The primary way that Dal Quor manifests in the world is through dreams.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>The metaphysical damage caused in the conflict between Dal Quor and the giants of Xen’drik broke the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor. There are no naturally occurring manifest zones to Dal Quor, and even plane shift won’t allow travel there. However, though natural manifest zones don’t exist, anything is possible with an eldritch machine, whether in the hands of the Dreaming Dark pursuing subtle conquest, or simply an eccentric artificer seeking the advancement of arcane science.</p>\n<h3>Quori artifacts</h3>\n<p>While it’s rare to encounter objects on Eberron that come from Dal Quor, the Inspired of Sarlona create objects using quori techniques. The primary substance used in quori objects is a form of solidified emotion called sentira. It has an opalescent, organic texture similar to polished horn; the color depends on the emotion used in its creation, and the wearer can feel that emotion as a constant background presence in their mind. As a material, sentira is light and extremely strong, similar to mithral; an agent of the Dreaming Dark might wear armor that’s functionally mithral armor but actually made from sentira. Quori items generally enhance telepathy or other psychic effects; a ring of mind shielding or crystal ball of mind reading would be logical creations of the quori.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/dal-quor-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_121a6s029xu","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

However, the sheer size of most houses means that few house members can claim any sort of relationship outside their immediate family unit within the house. House Vadalis is the exception to this rule.</p>\n<p>While the other houses have done their best to increase their size and influence on Khorvaire, House Vadalis has taken almost the opposite stance. Every Vadalis heir over the age of 10 can recite his family lineage on both sides for several generations. This is not a matter of rote memorization for the purpose of pride, but information that sees daily use. Through this knowledge, any heirs of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} can determine their exact relationship to one another within an hour's time. This in turn creates a strong bond between them. It is one thing to work alongside someone who shares your name, but another to aid your grandmother's sister's great-grandson—at least to a Vadalis heir.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} is a family first and a business second. Commercial deals that might threaten the larger family unit are ignored, while plans with less profit that accommodate the house's structure are taken up instead. The other houses are routinely astounded by the Vadalis way, often ridiculing the house's limited wealth and influence, but Vadalis simply takes a different view of the world. In their minds, no one of their blood is a stranger, and no amount of money can take the place of kin.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Vadalis]{Organizations in House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis as an Organization]{House Vadalis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{People of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis in the World]{House Vadalis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Vadalis]{Playing a Member of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Family Business]{Family Business}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-vadalis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_aox13eajy0c","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

It hires adventurers to protect the nobility and royalty of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, to work as mercenaries for private interests, or to track down criminals when the local law lacks the resources (or the inclination) to do so. It provides a built-in series of adventure hooks to keep characters busy and players involved.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} was founded centuries ago from a family of warlords in the area that would later become @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. They were the first humans to manifest dragonmarks, and the Mark of Sentinel was only the fourth dragonmark to appear in mainland Khorvaire. The skill of Deneith warlords in battle was already well known, and when the mark appeared in their bloodline, it only added to their fearsome reputation. For over four hundred years, they ruled over the area near modern-day Karrlakton. Then war and a cycle of famine weakened the Deneith leadership and allowed rival factions to challenge it. For nearly two hundred years, war and strife ravaged the land until the rise of its greatest ruler: Karrn the Conqueror.</p>\n<p>Karrn was born and grew to manhood in the lands nominally held by the Deneith warlords. More than one scholar has hypothesized that Karrn might, in fact, have been a member of the Deneith bloodline, though the lack of dragonmarks in his descendants makes that unlikely. Legends tell of how the leaders of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} pledged themselves to Karrn even before he began his quest for power, though their reasons for doing so have been lost to time. Deneith heirs fought at Karrn's side from the beginning, and this ancient link of service helped shape Deneith into the house it is today.</p>\n<p>From the founding of Karrnath, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} served as both defender of the realm and enforcer of laws. When Galifar grew to adulthood and set out to create his empire, Deneith served him as well. After his kingdom was forged, Galifar I gave @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} the duty of defending the entire realm, increasing its jurisdiction fivefold. This new service made considerable use of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks Guild}, for special assignments both in and outside the nation's borders, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Defenders Guild}, to protect members of the nobility and dignitaries. The Sentinel Marshals were also formed during Galifar's reign, standing as the king's right arm against enemies of the realm.</p>\n<p>Promotion within Deneith is based on service to the house, drawing on merit and seniority rather than bloodlines or personal favoritism.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} are respected by the nobility of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, who typically have an initial attitude of friendly toward a Deneith heir and her acquaintances. At the same time, the criminal elements of Khorvaire despise and fear the Sentinel Marshals, and thus @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} as a whole. Criminals who recognize characters as being from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} have an attitude of unfriendly.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>Although @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} has enclaves across Khorvaire, its seat of power is in Karrlakton, just across the river from the Mournland. Sentinel Tower is Deneith's ancestral home, named in honor of the mark its members bear. Deneith families often send young heirs to be fostered here as children, creating a connection that lasts the rest of their lives. The Tower is the headquarters for all Sentinel Marshals, who return whenever their assignments permit.</p>\n<p>Sentinel Tower is an ancient keep, reputedly older than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} itself. It has undergone extensive expansion over the years, both for defensive purposes and to accommodate growth within the house. Even at its current size, Sentinel Tower cannot contain Deneith's entire complement of house members and hirelings. As a result, Karrlakton is filled with training areas, barracks, weaponsmiths, armorers, and taverns to serve the needs of the tower.</p>\n<p>In addition to Sentinel Tower, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} holds large enclaves in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} and Korth (where the impressive fortress sprawls over an entire hilltop), as well as estates in Flamekeep, Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, Stormreach, Taer Valaestas, Trolanport, and Varna. More outposts can be found in locations throughout Khorvaire, including Rhukaan Draal in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} (where Deneith keeps a low profile in the shadow of the prominent @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Tharashk} enclave). Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} are also the protectors of Thronehold, and make up the elite unit of Throne Wardens charged with protecting the Galifaran throne.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} is an excellent fit for dragonmarked and unmarked characters alike.

DMs can take advantage of the types of contracts Deneith has available to motivate players and give them direction. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} can also provide solid reasons to move characters around Khorvaire at a whim, following their clients from the jungles of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Q'barra]{Q'barra} to the cogs of Sharn, all within a single campaign.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Organizations in House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{People of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]{House Deneith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith in the World]{House Deneith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Deneith]{Playing a Member of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Neutrality and Law]{Neutrality and Law}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uglugyq15vm","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"3XiFVlAtXACGC1QQ","name":"Droaam: Religion in Droaam","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Religion in Droaam</h1>\n<p>Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Domain believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.</p>\n<p>Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed—an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.</p>\n<p>The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find your path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species—from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.</p>\n<p>All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.</p>\n<p>Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.</p>\n<p>There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam— the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: What Defines Droaam?]{What Defines Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam]{Political Structure of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Law and Order]{Law and Order}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Religion in Droaam]{Religion in Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?]{Why Go to Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Economy of Droaam]{Economy of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Power Groups}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Each house is a conglomerate of sorts, running businesses and industries related to the magical marks that some scions of each bloodline carry. The dragonmarked houses transcend the borders of the nations of Khorvaire, operating wherever supply and demand warrants. Each house offers services that few other merchants can match due to their size, their diplomatic status, and the power of their dragonmarks. These services include transportation, protection, manufacturing, healing, and a variety of other functions unique to Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>The Courier's Guild of House Orien operates a mail service, carrying messages and packages across Khorvaire by horse and the house's lightning rail. Sending a letter by mail is inexpensive; sending a package or a message by way of a courier is more secure but more expensive. If security is particularly important, House Sivis can protect written messages using magic, such as the illusory script spell, and House Kundarak can secure packages with the glyph of warding spell. The gnomes of House Sivis also maintain a network of speaking stones (described in chapter 5) to facilitate instantaneous communication across long distances. Short messages pass from one stone to another one within a network of message stations.

Travelers can always make their way by horse or coach, which might employ draft animals magebred by House Vadalis for speed or endurance. House Vadalis also supplies exotic mounts such as hippogriffs and griffons. Elemental galleons use bound air or water elementals to propel them. Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils-and tedium-of the roads. The lightning rail uses bound elementals to pull a train ofcarriages over a path of magical stones, between which a rail-like stream of lightning arcs. If speed is an issue, you can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship, which uses a bound elemental to hold a ship aloft and propel it through the air. This is almost the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. Elemental airships are a recent innovation and are relatively rare; many cities don't yet have docking towers. For those with no time to spare and plenty of money to spend, House Orien also has teleportation circles in each ofits enclaves in cities across Khorvaire. At significant cost, a member of the house will transport passengers instantaneously from one enclave to another. The Travel Services table summarizes the cost of traveling by these extraordinary means.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Travel Services</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Service</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">House</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Cost</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Speed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Airship</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}</td>\n<td>1 gp per mile</td>\n<td>20 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Elemental Galleon</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}</td>\n<td>5 sp per mile</td>\n<td>10 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Lightning Rail (Steerage)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>2 cp per mile</td>\n<td>30 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Lightning Rail (Standard)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>2 sp per mile</td>\n<td>30 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Lightning Rail (First Class)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>5 sp per mile</td>\n<td>30 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Lightning Rail (Cargo)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>5 cp per mile per 100 lbs.</td>\n<td>30 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Magebred coach</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>3 sp per mile</td>\n<td>5 mph</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Teleportation</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}</td>\n<td>2,500 gp</td>\n<td>Instant</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Protection</h2>\n<p>xxxx</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Communication and Security Services</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Service</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">House</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Black Blade</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}</td>\n<td>2 sp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Gray Blade</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}</td>\n<td>6 sp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">WhiteBlade</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}</td>\n<td>3 gp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Gold Blade</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}</td>\n<td>12 gp per day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_w20aa8nuflh","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves' attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves phiarlans, a word meaning \"spirit keeper.\" As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p>\n<h2>AERENAL AND THE UNDYING COURT</h2>\n<p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels—knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the undying court, the phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one—bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served.</p>\n<h2>THE MARK OF SHADOW</h2>\n<p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons—the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>This exodus included the vast majority of the phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>PHIARLAN IN KHORVAIRE</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan's reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p>\n<p>In 972 YK, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries.

A castle sprawls atop the peak, a glittered fortress sculpted from brass. Firefalls of lava tumble down the edge of the spire. A flight of red dragons takes to the air, circling the castle and creating a dazzling spectacle of synchronized flames. Welcome to High Hearth: the party’s about to begin.</p>\n<p>It’s simple to say that Fernia embodies the concept of fire. The plane is filled with magma and flame, from massive volcanoes to cities eternally on the verge of being consumed by fire. But Fernia isn’t about mundane fire; Lamannia is the source of simple, natural flame, and holds volcanoes and fire elementals. Rather, Fernia is about all the things we see in the flame, all the ideas it represents. It has layers reflecting wild destruction, where verdant forests eternally burn. It incorporates industry, with legions of azers forever toiling over fire and forge. And it reflects wild passion, burning emotions that can’t be held in, and glorious spectacle; these are the realm of the efreet, the lords of the Sea of Flame, forever striving to outshine their rivals.</p>\n<p>Fire draws the eye and the attention, but where there’s magma, there’s also earth. The azers stand between earth and flame, harvesting the ore they feed to their hungry forges. And in the deep caverns, the dao polish jewels and admire their treasures. Even in these deep layers, the air sears the lungs of creatures that lack the proper protection, but for adventurers willing to brave the flames, wonders and wealth are waiting in the halls of fire and stone.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>The sweltering heat of Fernia can be deadly to unprotected creatures, and it burns through mortal metabolisms. The following properties apply to the entire plane.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/fernia-symbol.webp\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Deadly Heat. </strong>All regions of Fernia are subject to extreme heat (as defined in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). In some areas of particularly deadly heat, a creature without protection must make a Constitution saving throw every minute instead of every hour. In addition, all creatures gain resistance to cold damage, and a creature that is usually resistant to cold damage becomes immune to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowered Fire. </strong>When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals fire damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.</p>\n<p><strong>Fires of Industry. </strong>A creature has advantage on ability checks using tools (such as baking with cook’s utensils, or forging an item with smith’s tools) when it incorporates Fernian flame into its action in place of mundane flame.</p>\n<p><strong>Burning Bright.</strong> Whenever a creature makes a death saving throw, it must make an additional saving throw, keeping the results of both rolls. In addition, when a creature gains a level of exhaustion, it gains an extra level; when it reduces a level of exhaustion, it reduces it by an additional level. In Fernia, whether you live or die, it’s going to happen quickly!</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Time. </strong>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways Fernia can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>manIfest Zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Fernia often share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Those with Deadly Heat often have unusual volcanic or tectonic activity, and are generally shunned. However, House Cannith is always searching for Fernian zones with the Fires of Industry property; in addition to providing advantage on tool checks, these zones often allow artificers to craft enchantments that can’t be replicated elsewhere (especially those tied to evocation and flame). A Fernian manifest zone can provide an unexpected haven in an arctic environment, or provide unusual geothermal benefits. In Karrnath, the town of Ember—on the edge of the Icetop Mountains—is renowned for its pleasant climate and thermal pools.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>While Fernia is coterminous, temperatures rise sharply, and warmer regions that would normally be safe can become extremely hot, taking on the Deadly Heat, Empowered Fire, and Burning Bright properties of the plane. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense flame can find themselves pulled through to Fernia itself.</p>\n<p>When Fernia is remote, intense heat loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat, as well as on saving throws against spells that deal fire damage.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Fernia is coterminous once every five years during the month of Lharvion, and it’s remote once every five years during the month of Zarantyr (exactly two and a half years after it’s coterminous).</p>\n<h3>Fernian artiFaCts</h3>\n<p>The dao and the foundries of Fernia produce a vast array of wonders. Many of their creations are effectively trinkets, such as a gold model of a dragon that breathes actual fire. Others are far grander, such as figurines of wondrous power. While many Fernian artifacts relate to fire in some way—wands of fireball, flame tongue swords—they aren’t limited to fire or evocation. Fernian items are often made from brass, obsidian, or basalt, but the dao work with all metals.</p>\n<p>Two additional resources from Fernia are cold fire and Fernian ashes. Cold fire is a form of continual flame that occurs naturally in Fernia; the flames have the texture of warm putty. Fernian ashes are created from the wood of rare trees found only in the Sea of Fire. Fernian ashes are a potent component of magic items tied to the evocation school. In addition, if a spellcaster discards a pinch of Fernian ashes while casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, their spell deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. Both Fernian ashes and cold fire can occasionally be harvested from Fernian manifest zones, though not all trees will produce Fernian ashes.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/fernia-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_l0gste8qzva","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

{"_id":"4W1dklk7A1UGkYJr","name":"Lamannia","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Lamannia</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Twilight Forest</h2>\n<p>Lamannia embodies primordial nature, untapped and untamable. It’s often called the Twilight Forest, and is depicted as a realm of colossal trees and massive beasts. However, the forest is just one of the facets of Lamannia. Every natural environment is represented in various layers that exemplify and exaggerate their features. Windswept desert, raging ocean, endless plains—all can be found here. In other planes, these environments are backdrops to the story the realm is telling. In Lamannia, the environment is the story. It doesn’t need the help of fey or fiends to make its point, because the land itself is the point.</p>\n<p>Some scholars assert that Lamannia served as a blueprint for the Material Plane—that here, the Progenitors perfected the ideas of storm and stone. They believe that the natural world is infused with the essence of Lamannia, and that druids and others who wield primal magic actually manipulate that Lamannian essence. And indeed, druids who travel to the Twilight Forest can be overwhelmed by the sheer force of nature that infuses this place.</p>\n<p>Lamannia lies close to the world, and it’s one of the easiest planes to reach. Its treasures are natural objects imbued with elemental power—wood, stone, herbs, and plants, all of which are stronger and more potent than their mortal counterparts. But when you come to Lamannia, there are many predators, and you are prey; anyone who seeks to despoil the embodiment of nature will be hunted.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Lamannia is a reflection of the natural world, intensified and exaggerated. The air is pure and clean, the water fresh and clear. Colors are impossibly vivid. It’s suffused with life—a realm in which any stone could be an earth elemental, where any tree could be awakened. Vegetation is nearly always in bloom, and beasts are almost always in the peak of health. Except for a few layers such as the Rot, Lamannia reflects the ideal state of the natural world. Here are some of the plane’s consistent properties.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/lamannia-symbol.webp\" width=\"224\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Extended Druidic Magic.</strong> When a creature casts a druid spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer while in Lamannia, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected. A DM could decide to extend this effect to other characters that draw on primal sources of magic, such as a Gatekeeper ranger or a Greensinger bard.</p>\n<p><strong>Indomitable Beasts. </strong>Beasts and elementals have a +2 bonus to Constitution and advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws. Upon its arrival in Lamannia, any elemental or beast that’s charmed or bound in any way is immediately freed from that effect; this can be disastrous for an elemental airship that’s thrown into the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Power.</strong> When a creature casts a spell that summons or conjures an elemental, it does so as if the spell were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.</p>\n<p><strong>The Land Provides. </strong>A creature has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to forage for food or shelter. In most layers of Lamannia, the vegetation is bountiful and the land sustaining. (While in the Broken Land, it may be very difficult to forage, but you’ll at least have advantage to help you with the roll!)</p>\n<p><strong>Primordial Matter.</strong> It’s difficult to destroy or contaminate the matter of Lamannia. All nonmagical food and drink is purified and rendered free of poison and disease. In addition, natural materials such as wood and stone are tougher than their mundane counterparts. When trying to destroy objects made of Lamannian materials, increase the Armor Class suggested in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide by 3, and double the hit points of the object.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Time.</strong> Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>A town is established in the desolate Blade Desert, but it thrives beside a small lake that provides fresh water and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fish. In a small Eldeen village, the locals live in harmony with a breed of giant rabbits unknown elsewhere in Khorvaire. A tribe of shifters lives in the branches of three massive trees that grow in a Lamannian manifest zone. These are all examples of how Lamannia can affect the Material Plane; below are a few more.</p>\n<h3>ManiFesT Zones</h3>\n<p>Lamannian manifest zones are relatively common, and usually share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. They’re often found at the heart of a region that resembles the connected layer; zones tied to the Endless Ocean are found underwater, while manifest zones tied to the Twilight Forest can be found in the Towering Wood, the King’s Forest, and other vast woodlands. It’s relatively common for these zones to serve as gateways to Lamannia, though they might require a lunar alignment or a coterminous period. This goes in reverse too, as creatures can be pulled through to the Material Plane, from hostile elementals to deadly megafauna.</p>\n<p>Zilargo has a number of valuable zones with the Elemental Power property, and House Cannith and the Twelve are eager to find more of these zones—though they’re also dangerous, as elementals sometimes spontaneously manifest in such places, linger for a few hours, then dissipate. Bound elementals can also break free from their bonds in some Lamannian manifest zones—especially unfortunate if that elemental is responsible for keeping an airship aloft!</p>\n<p>Plants and beasts near Lamannian zones often are significantly larger and healthier than their counterparts in other areas, and many House Vadalis enclaves are built in these zones. Zones with the Primordial Matter property can also be a valuable resource for communities, with purified food and water and the presence of extremely durable wood and other materials for industry. The prison of Dreadhold is built in such a manifest zone.</p>\n<p>However, though Lamannian manifest zones can be useful tools for communities and dragonmarked houses, some zones actively resist and repel civilization. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay can combine to quickly destroy structures built in the zone and overgrow the ruins.</p>\n<h3>CoTerMinous and reMoTe</h3>\n<p>While Lamannia is coterminous, the effects of Lamannian manifest zones are enhanced. In regions of unspoiled nature— such as the Eldeen Reaches and the wilds of Q’barra—fertility of both plants and animals is enhanced, and beasts conceived in these periods are often exceptionally strong and healthy. Spells that target beasts or elementals are extended; if a spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.</p>\n<p>While Lamannia is remote, fertility rates drop, and beasts born in these periods are often weak or sickly. Animals are often uneasy, and the duration of spells that affect beasts or elementals are cut in half, to a minimum duration of one round.</p>\n<p>Lamannia traditionally becomes coterminous for a week around the summer solstice, and is remote for a week during the winter solstice.</p>\n<h3>laMannian arTiFaCTs</h3>\n<p>Lamannian vegetation is prized by alchemists. Herbs and roots from Lamannia can produce exceptionally strong potions, and many types of Lamannian vegetation have innate magical effects; there are bushes in the Twilight Forest that naturally produce goodberries. Lamannian lumber likewise can have unusual properties, mirroring the densewood and bronzewood found in Aerenal. Lamannian wood and stone can serve as powerful focuses for primal magic, for creating figurines of wondrous power, or for tools designed to summon or bind elementals.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/lamannia-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6q5tcslkt0e","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

And in a time of fragile peace, business is booming. During the Last War, House Deneith managed to maintain its neutrality while supplying soldiers to all of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Today, members of the house guard monarchs across Khorvaire, hunt down criminals who flee across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations'} porous borders, and even guard the empty throne in Thronehold.

Though its fortunes rose during the Last War, the services Deneith renders are no less valuable in times of peace. Today, the house is as prosperous as ever, with its position of neutrality firmly established and a host of eager clients ready to use its services. This prosperity tells only half the story, however, and Deneith's past fortunes might not be enough to guarantee the house's future.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Organizations in House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{People of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]{House Deneith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith in the World]{House Deneith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Deneith]{Playing a Member of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Neutrality and Law]{Neutrality and Law}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-coa.webp\" width=\"276\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>The first humans to exhibit dragon marks were members of a militant noble family with ancestral lands in what is now @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. With the dragon mark bolstering their military prowess, the Deneith family conquered most of the region; only famine prevented them from carving out their own kingdom in what is now western @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. The Deneith homeland was also the home of Karrn the Conqueror. Although he was not a member of the family, House Deneith pledged fealty to Karrn during his rise to power. When Galifar I united the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, he charged the house with the protection of his vast new realm.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> Most members of House Deneith are culturally Karrnathi, but the house refused to choose sides in the Last War. Instead, House Deneith offered mercenaries from its @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks Guild} to all of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Deneith crafted its contracts to ensure that Deneith fighters would never cross swords with other Deneith. (One Cyran general was infuriated when the blademarks under his command wouldn't attack a Deneith-guarded garrison. The Cyrans attacked the blademarks who refused to fight, but were routed by the combined forces of the blademarks and the Deneith garrison guards.)</p>\n<p>House Deneith generally remains at arm's length from political maneuvering among the other dragonmarked houses. But since the Last War, it has started to make cautious moves against @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}. The reason is simple: In the latter days of the war, both made significant inroads against Deneith's dominance in the soldiers-for-hire market. Every warforged soldier built by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and every (sometimes monstrous) mercenary offered by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} is direct competition.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Baron Breven d'Deneith}: </strong>A strong idealistic commander, seeing the need for balance and practicality.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Sigor d'Deneith}:</strong> Survived the Day of Mourning by luck, Sigor is now obsessed with finding out what caused the Mourning.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Sentinel Tower: </strong>Older than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} itself, the ancient keep known as Sentinel Tower is the main enclave of House Deneith, the headquarters of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Sentinel Marshals}, and a fortress charged with repulsing periodic monster attacks from the Mournland, just across the river. Its history is rich; Karrn the Conqueror commissioned the first of his generals atop Sentinel Tower. The keep is a confusing maze of fortifications, since its defenses have been renovated and augmented numerous times.</p>\n<p><strong>Graywall Outpost:</strong> Early in the Last War, House Deneith accepted a contract from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} to guard a key mountain pass in the Graywall Mountains between central Breland and what is now @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. In 987 YK, when King Boranel's armies retreated from the Graywalls, House Deneith remained in a stubborn effort to hold up its end of the contract. For the next nine years, the soldiers of the house were often near starvation, frequently under siege, and always surrounded, but they held the mountain pass. Even the war's end couldn't dislodge House Deneith, and it has built a small but nearly impregnable keep. Although @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} (for military reasons) and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} (for political reasons) would like to see the outpost abandoned, House Deneith shows no sign of leaving.</p>\n<p><strong>Rhukaan Draal Enclave:</strong> Many of House Deneith's goblin mercenaries rebelled in 969 YK (an event that led to the founding of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}). House Deneith has carefully reestablished relations with the Lhesh Haruuc (leader of the insurrection and now of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}). This relationship is one of convenience: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun} gets diplomatic legitimacy through the association, and House Deneith gets a steady stream of goblin mercenaries. But some within the house are still bitter about Haruuc's insurrection; the enclave in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun} is a tense place to do business.</p>\n<p>The Rhukaan Draal enclave has two parts: a diplomatic enclave within Rhukaan Draal called Fort Cail (after Lord Cail d'Deneith, who first recruited goblins to fight under the Deneith banner more than a century ago), and a fortress known as the Gathering Stone just outside the city, where many blade marks receive their initial training in large-unit tactics.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/house-deneith-guard.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uglugyq15vm","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Like the complex tidal forces of the world’s twelve moons, the power of each plane waxes and wanes, affecting the world in dramatic and subtle ways. Sages often speak of the planes as drawing near to the world or becoming remote from it, as if the planes were satellites orbiting the world.</p>\n<p>At certain places in the Material Plane, the barriers between worlds are thin. Some characteristics of another plane can bleed through into the material world, and they demonstrate this influence in a variety of ways. These places are called manifest zones, and the nature of each one is strongly shaped by the plane it connects to.</p>\n<p>The Gloaming, a region within the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, has a close connection to the region of the Astral Sea known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mabar]{Mabar}, the Endless Night. That connection has corrupted life within the manifest zone, creating deadly plants, monstrous vermin, and pervasive sickness. Not too far distant, the Twilight Demesne is a manifest zone tied to the Faerie Court of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thelanis]{Thelanis}; this demesne serves as a sort of planar crossroads for traffic between the world and the Feywild. The city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} is located in a manifest zone linked to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Syrania]{Syrania} that keeps its towers reaching toward the sky and aids flight.

Most manifest zones have reliable, persistent effects. Some have only weak connections to their planes, and their properties influence the world only when the plane is coterminous. Smaller and less important manifest zones appear across Eberron, and new ones can appear even as old ones wink out of existence. Eldritch machines and exotic rituals can create manifest zones, amplify their effects, or draw on planar connections to create dramatic new features.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_fbecy18xb1d","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

As with the other @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, Breland’s borders have fluctuated over time. It was named for King Galifar I’s daughter, Brey, in the year 32 YK.</p>\n<p>During the reign of Galifar’s last king, Wroann ir’Wynarn governed the nation. King Jarot’s youngest daughter, Wroann was the exact opposite of her twin brother, Wrogar of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. She was thin and agile, serious, and a lover of the finer things in life. She also cherished freedom above all things, and promised to make Breland a place where people would be judged by word and deed instead of social class.</p>\n<p>When Jarot died, Wroann broke with her twin regarding the line of succession. Instead of supporting Mishann of Cyre’s claim to the throne, Wroann gathered her vassals and declared her own intention to rule the kingdom. Ironically, the freedom-loving nation of Breland was one of the key instigators of the Last War, for her leader wanted to spread her ideas of liberty and increased democracy to all by force and sword.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Last War, the nation of Breland covered all the land it holds today, as well as what is now @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}. Currently, the kingdom consists of the land between the Graywall Mountains and the Howling Peaks, reaching as far north as the Blackcaps and Lake Galifar, and as far south as the southern coast of the continent.</p>\n<h2>AFTERMATH OF THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} at various points of the war, as well as clashing with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.</p>\n<p>The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wroat]{Wroat} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Vathirond]{Vathirond} is still repairing the damage from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.</p>\n<p>Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"5GqA2HKfIvVcnWyq","name":"Lyrandar Airship","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Lyrandar Airship</h1>\n<p>The airship is the most advanced elemental-powered vehicle on Eberron, the pride of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} and the forerunner of the magical advances that many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the Last War. The first airships emerged from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} workshops and appeared in House Lyrandar's service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.</p>\n<p>Soarwood is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail's pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement worth a handsome reward from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.</p>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p>A standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An air or fire elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.</p>\n<h3>Operation</h3>\n<p>A dragonmarked heir of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the wheel of wind and water that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the conductor stones that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.</p>\n<p>Only a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command the bound elemental. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} pilots train for months to gain a deep understanding of the ship's powers and limitations. Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.</p>\n<p>Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. Unlike most flying creatures, they don't rely on wings for lift thanks to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew).</p>\n<p>Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.</p>\n<p>A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers who demand luxury—clients who have a need to move quickly to places that might not be served by the lightning rail.</p>\n<h3>Suppression</h3>\n<p>Although the elemental bound to the airship is essential for propulsion, the vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. When the elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can't move. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to maneuver the vessel into position.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/airship-01.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_r7kwiq8l1j","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/09.

You see the world around you as an intricate web of schemes, plots, and counterplots. Assessing the range of possibilities, you use instinct to predict and defend against those that threaten your clients, and do so well before threats can turn to danger. Defending against an assassin's blade is a job that any @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith} sellsword or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Tharashk} enforcer can do well enough. Making sure that blade is never drawn is the Medani way.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>You are trained to handle yourself in a straight-up fight, but the best defense is to eliminate a foe before he has a chance to join battle. When combat is necessary, you engage on your own best terms. Ambush, surprise, debilitating poison or magic, the advantages of terrain—all are tools in your arsenal, and you have no compunction against using them. In combat as in all things, you seek to predict the actions of others and execute your response in such a way that the foe never sees it coming. If your tactics fail, no quarter will be asked or given. The safety of the client comes first—everything else is academic.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Advancing in the Medani hierarchy is not necessarily dependent on performance in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild}. Though you will be encouraged to consider joining the guild, Medani recognizes that not everyone is suited for its rigorous (and sometimes dangerous) fieldwork. In fact, a number of house patriarchs have never been members of the guild—most notably Stavros, a great tactician of five centuries past who lost the use of his legs as a child.</p>\n<p>Your house is a close-knit one, but the nature of your work makes you constantly aware of the danger of betrayal and infiltration. However, from the moment you prove yourself, you are part of an elite group. Your family and people dedicate their lives to others—watching, waiting, and ensuring that those in their care live to see tomorrow unharmed.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>When not tasked with a specific assignment (most often protecting nobles or the dragonmarked elite from assassination, kidnapping, and the like), you will find yourself engaged in Medani's more general business of sifting the plots that run rampant in Khorvaire. When the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild} hears a growing rumor of a new @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} incursion, you follow those rumors from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} and beyond—confirming these plots by shutting them down. When a noble is blackmailed, you are not content to simply keep terms of the payment quiet, but will work your way back to discover who gave the order, and why. Beneath the veneer of civil politics, the plots of Khorvaire are given life by noble courts, criminal guilds, and dragonmarked houses alike. In the end, you see through their deception as no one else can.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Organizations in House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Medani]{People of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani as an Organization]{House Medani as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani in the World]{House Medani in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Medani]{Playing a Member of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Warning Signs]{Warning Signs}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-medani-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_d88gz4ty0vs","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"5tYnP51pJTM5F1Uq","name":"Wages of Sin","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Wages of Sin</h1>\n<p>A party of adventurers clashes with an Aurum mastermind and sends him to a richly deserved grave. But another member of the Platinum Concord sees to it that the heroes are brought to trial for this so-called murder and ultimately they are convicted. What happens next?</p>\n<p>This section describes a few of the more common forms of punishment used by the courts of Sharn. It is up to the DM to decide how severe the punishment should be based on the nature of the crime. As with any use of the law, the challenge is to find a way for the punishment to enhance the adventure and challenge the party as opposed to ruining the story.</p>\n<h3>IMPRISONMENT</h3>\n<p>Long-term incarceration is rarely used as a form of punishment in Breland. Prisons are primarily used as holding cells, keeping criminals contained until a case can go to trial and a final punishment can be decreed. If a prisoner is deemed too dangerous to be allowed to roam free, she is usually executed; Breland has just emerged from a century of war, and death is a reality of the world. There is only one situation in which an extended prison sentence would be warranted: If the prisoner cannot be allowed to go free and if his death would have major repercussions. For example, if a cousin of Queen Aurala of Aundair committed a serious act of treason, his execution could provoke Aundair to renew the war; instead, he would be held in the Citadel, while King Boranel contacted Aurala and demanded reparations for the crime. A lengthy prison sentence could also occur if a trial fails to resolve doubts about the crime; the magistrate can rule that the accused be detained while a further investigation occurs.</p>\n<h3>FINES</h3>\n<p>Fines are the most common form of punishment used by the courts of Sharn. The fine is based on the nature of the crime, but the magistrate has leeway to raise the amount of the fine to ensure that it actually serves as an effective punishment. For a commoner, a 10-gp fine is crippling; for an experienced adventurer, it is trivial, and the magistrate ensures that the criminal feels the loss. What may hurt adventurers more than fines of gold is confiscation of items; weapons, armor, wands, and similar treasures may be taken away if a character is convicted of using them in a criminal manner. This can allow the DM to force a party to rebuild its strength after losing powerful items— or the characters can make an adventure out of breaking into the vaults of the Citadel to reclaim their impounded goods!</p>\n<h3>HARD LABOR</h3>\n<p>If a convicted criminal can't afford to pay a fine, he is assigned to work off his debt in a chain gang. There are a number of city-owned workhouses throughout Sharn, including the Bazaar of Dura and the Ashblack foundries. The work is extremely unpleasant, and the prisoner pays off his debt at a rate of 1 sp/day.</p>\n<h3>BRANDING</h3>\n<p>Repeat offenders are often marked with a symbol that warns others about their criminal tendencies. In the past, these marks were made with branding irons. In this more civilized age, a House Sivis heir inscribes the mark using a pen of the living parchment (see page 169). Marks are either placed on the forehead or on the back of the right hand, and guards often demand that suspicious strangers remove their gloves and show the backs of their hands. A criminal's mark causes most law-abiding citizens to have an unfriendly reaction to the character, and he may be refused service at respectable businesses. However, in the bad parts of Sharn a criminal mark is a badge of honor, and other criminals often treat marked men with more respect.</p>\n<h3>MYSTICAL PUNISHMENT</h3>\n<p>The clerics of Aureon may be called upon to use magic to punish wrongdoing. A few spells are often used as punishment.</p>\n<p>Curse is a common form of magical punishment used against repeat offenders. A –4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks can prove to be a serious setback to muggers, con artists, and pickpockets alike.</p>\n<p>Blindness/deafness is occasionally used as a form of punishment. Most often blindness is applied to dangerous prisoners who are going to be incarcerated in the Citadel; the magical handicap is simply one more way of preventing escape.</p>\n<p>In high profile cases, High Priest Phthaso Mogan may be called in to place a mark of justice on the criminal. This is often used as an alternative to prison when guilt is still in question; if the accused character stays on the righteous path, the mark is never triggered.</p>\n<h3>EXILE</h3>\n<p>Exile is considerably more common than longterm incarceration. Depending on the severity of the crime, the character may be exiled from Sharn or from Breland itself. In either case, the victim is marked with a pen of the living parchment (see page 169) to indicate his status, and if he returns after exile he may be executed or sentenced to an extended period of hard labor.</p>\n<h3>OUTLAW</h3>\n<p>A criminal who has proven himself unfit to be a member of society, yet who is not deemed worthy of execution, may be branded as an outlaw. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the Galifar Code of Justice, and anyone may do anything they like to him without fear of legal retribution. He may be beaten, robbed, or even killed with no consequence. While the status of exile generally only affects the character in one nation, the mark of the outlaw is recognized in all of the Five Nations, and any nation that respects the Galifar Code of Justice looks suspiciously on exiled outlaws. As a result, outlaws usually congregate in Darguun, Droaam, the Shadow Marches, Xen'drik, the Lhazaar Principalities, and Q'barra—nations that either ignore the Galifar Code or that believe a man can overcome a criminal past.</p>\n<h3>EXECUTION</h3>\n<p>Executions are rare, but the magistrates are always prepared to eliminate a criminal who is seen as posing a serious ongoing threat to the community. Typically, the death sentence is only invoked for murder or treason of the highest degree. Hanging is the standard form of execution, but criminals (notably warforged criminals) have been beheaded in the past.</p>\n<h3>SPECIAL SERVICES</h3>\n<p>Adventurers are generally remarkable, highly talented individuals. People in power—city councilors, guard commanders—often keep an eye on skilled adventurers. Such people often have jobs they need done—often shady tasks they can't afford to be openly associated with—and adventurers seem ideally suited for this sort of work. As a result, a party charged with a crime may be approached by an influential personage before trial and given a choice. If they perform the requested task, the slate is wiped clean. If not, the VIP uses her power to ensure that the upcoming trial goes poorly for the adventurers. Shadier individuals—such as Councilor Thurik Davandi of Upper Menthis or Commander Lian Halamar of Upper Dura—may frame the party as a way of forcing them to perform a special service.</p>\n<h2>Prisons of Sharn</h2>\n<p>There are five prisons in Sharn—one in each of the garrisons of the Sharn Watch, and the high-security prison in the Citadel of Central Plateau.</p>\n<p>The garrison prisons are designed to hold prisoners until trial, and are not intended for long-term use. Each prison contains 10 separate cells, each of which can hold 8 prisoners. Spellcasters, monks, or other characters considered to be high escape risks are chained to the wall using masterwork manacles (hardness 10, 10 hp, break DC 28, Escape Artist DC 35, Open Lock DC 30), and suspected spellcasters are usually gagged. Each cell has an iron door (hardness 10, 60 hp, break DC 28, Open Lock DC 40) and thick stone walls (hardness 8, 180 hp, break DC 40). Typically, a prison is guarded by a 5-person Watch detail.</p>\n<p>The prison of the Citadel is designed to hold dangerous prisoners for extended periods of time. The first security measure is simple: height. The prison is located at the top of the tower, and there is a 500-foot drop between the entry chamber of the prison and the observation deck below. The only access is via a magic lift that is open on the sides and can hold a maximum of six Medium humanoids. There are four sniper posts 150 feet up from the observation deck, each home to a 2nd-level fighter specialized in archery; these snipers have a clear view of the lift and can shoot at prisoners attempting to escape as the lift descends. The lift moves quite slowly—10 feet per round—giving the snipers and guards on the ground a considerable amount of time to prepare or to attack escapees. In addition to the four snipers, the observation deck is guarded by a Watch post and a countermage from the Blackened Book—a 4th-level abjurer equipped with a wand of dispel magic and a wand of force hammer. A central column in the observation deck includes a crystal ball with telepathy, which is used to monitor the cells of the prison and to communicate with the guards. The crystal ball was created as part of the stone column, which is itself fused with the floor of the chamber; it cannot be removed.</p>\n<p>The bottom level of the prison contains the guard barracks. Four Watch posts are stationed at the prison, along with another 4th-level countermage, a 5th-level cleric of Aureon (who maintains the glyphs of warding), and four Vadalis-trained horrid wolves. At any given time, one of the posts is off duty, while the other three patrol the upper levels. The second level contains the mess hall, recreation area, and bath hall. The third and fourth levels hold the prisoners. There are twenty-five cells on each level, each capable of holding up to four Medium prisoners. The walls are 2-foot-thick stone (hardness 8, 360 hp, break DC 45). All of the doors are locked with arcane seals; the doors on the third level are steel (hardness 10, 60 hp, break DC 28), while those on the fourth level are forged from adamantine (hardness 20, 80 hp, break DC 48). The hallways contain glyphs of warding holding blindness spells (save DC 15).</p>\n<p>Spellcasters, monks, and characters considered to be high escape risks are kept in masterwork manacles, just like in the garrison prisons. In addition, the guards have access to ten sets of wizard's manacles—four each of Small and Medium, and two sets of Large manacles.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6l2u8fsp5zw","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"63hOvMBcfOu6YDRW","name":"Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Political Structure of Droaam</h1>\n<p>The nation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it's constantly evolving. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice. As it stands, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} has been split into <em>lheshat</em>—a Goblin term meaning \"domain of a warlord.\" Each <em>lheshat </em>is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters}; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters}.</p>\n<p>For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city— though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent.</p>\n<p>Katra's vision is that all creatures of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse—foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.</p>\n<p>In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} and wielding authority throughout the land:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>The agents of <strong>Katra's Voice</strong> are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.</li>\n<li>A few elite soldiers of <strong>Maenya's Fist</strong> usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them.

{"_id":"6O1JWBJQ6ZPJYytC","name":"Mror History","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Mror History</h1>\n<p>Dwarves aren’t native to Khorvaire, but no one knows exactly how or when they arrived. Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that’s enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization—or ruins of it—waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there’s no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.</p>\n<h2>sol Udar: tHe realM Below</h2>\n<p>Wherever the dwarves came from, they sunk their roots into the soil of Khorvaire. Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records—which are more accurate than those of the dwarves—show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn’t worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call Sol Udar, the Realm Below.</p>\n<h2>Mallanok: The exile</h2>\n<p>The next major era in Mror history was Mallanok, the Exile. At some point—whether years or centuries later is unclear—a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn’t decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known.</p>\n<h2>Dul krok: BlooDy SToneS</h2>\n<p>The Exile was followed by Dul Krok, Bloody Stones. When humanity came to Khorvaire, the Ironroot Mountains were divided between thirteen powerful clans of dwarves. These mountain dwarves were proud and warlike, but they were mired in feuds—and these ancient conflicts kept them from substantially advancing their culture or their influence in the world. Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren’t the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what’s now the Lhazaar Principalities. It was largely these Lhazaar dwarves who integrated with humanity, spreading west with them, though there were also a few Mror who left their feuds behind to help build the foundations of the new kingdoms.</p>\n<h2>Bal Dulor: The GreaT Sorrow</h2>\n<p>As the Five Nations took form, humanity largely shunned the Ironroot Mountains and left the dwarves to their feuding. Following the rise of the united kingdom of Galifar, Prince Karrn finally made a concerted effort to pacify the mountain dwarves. This time is known as Bal Dulor, the Great Sorrow. The soldiers of Galifar were disciplined and took advantage of the existing feuds, isolating the clans or pitting them against one another. The central fortresses of the holds were impregnable, but Galifar held the surrounding lands; the compromise that followed left the dwarves as lords of their territories, but as subjects of Galifar, forced to pay tribute and taxes.</p>\n<h2>korran hal: korran’S BleSSinG</h2>\n<p>While the Great Sorrow was a source of deep shame to the dwarves, it brought a forced end to their violent feuds and forced them to raise the funds to pay their tribute. Warriors became miners, and the Ironroot Mountains proved to be an astonishingly rich source of mineral wealth. Mror talespinners say that the Sovereign Onatar had his forge in the mountains, and that Kol Korran kept his hoard beneath it; other scholars have speculated that there could be a more unsavory supernatural force at work, an overlord tied to greed bound beneath the peaks. Whatever the truth, this led to the period known as Korran Hal, Korran’s Blessing. Even with the taxes owed to Galifar, the Mror prospered and built a thriving society. While the ancient feuds were never forgotten, violence was no longer their first answer. The bearers of the Dragonmark of Warding, Clan Kundarak, were drawn into the Twelve and became House Kundarak. Working closely with House Sivis, Kundarak parleyed its wealth and the power of its dragonmark to establish the Banking Guild, and the influence of Kundarak helped to drive a further wave of cultural advancement.</p>\n<h2>Tra Halor: THe revelaTion</h2>\n<p>As the dwarves expanded their mines and fortress holds, they’d occasionally find tunnels and outposts that seemed to be tied to Sol Udar—outposts that appeared to have been abandoned many thousands of years ago. The dwarves continued to dig deeper toward the Realm Below, and this led to a wave of breakthroughs in the early tenth century, an event broadly known as tra Halor, the Revelation. Miners and masons found evidence of a vast, wondrous subterranean empire, with enormous city-halls below all of the modern holds. Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses. It was clear that these cities had been built by dwarves, and it speaks to Mror character that rather than pondering the fate of the builders of this abandoned realm, the dwarves simply embraced this as a miraculous stroke of fortune and proof of their collective destiny.</p>\n<h2>Mror Solu: THe realMS of iron</h2>\n<p>By this time, the Last War was underway. For the last decade, Karrnath had been steadily raising taxes and demanding troop levies. But the dwarves were conquered long ago by Galifar, whereas Karrnath was just a piece of that broken kingdom. Inspired by Sol Udar and recognizing how far their people had come since the Great Sorrow, the lords of the holds convened in Mror Aulan, the Iron Council. The lords of the Iron Council affirmed their union and declared the sovereignty of Mror Solu— the Realms of Iron—a name which even the Mror themselves usually translate into Common as the Mror Holds. It’s worth noting that in calling themselves the Mror, dwarves aren’t professing fealty to Clan Mroranon or the ancient king of Sol Udar; rather, they’re simply calling themselves “the Ironfolk.”</p>\n<h2>Dol uDar: THe War BeloW</h2>\n<p>The time that followed was initially known as Aul Aur, the Age of Gold. While Karrnath engaged in retaliatory actions during the Last War, it was struggling with famine and against its neighbors, and lacked the power to stop the rebellion. The dwarves expanded and explored Sol Udar, reclaiming wondrous relics and facilities. But soon they learned what had become of the ancient dwarves of the Realm Below, and why the kingdom had never reached up to the exiles. The ancient dwarves had been wiped out thousands of years ago by the daelkyr, for Sol Udar abutted on the demiplane prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the mightiest of the daelkyr. The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone—and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths. Entire colonies were lost and consumed by illithid corruption. While the Five Nations fought the Last War, the Mror fell into Dol Udar, the War Below, discussed in more detail later in “The Realm Below” section.</p>\n<p>Today, the Mror Holds are in a stalemate against the aberrations below, and remain balanced between the Age of Gold and the War Below. Even with their current holdings, the dwarves continue to draw vast wealth from their mines. Clans take pride in the treasures reclaimed from the depths, and Mror artificers continue to learn from studying ancient artifacts. Though the dwarves are few in number, their economic power and strong fortifications have deterred any Karrnathi retribution, and no one challenged their recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold. The dwarves are proud and prosperous—and yet, old feuds linger. The Realm Below remains both a glorious lure and a deadly threat. And tensions are further exacerbated by the other treasures recovered from the depths—tools made not by dwarves, but by the daelkyr.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_gljquzo8fvf","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Each line had its particular strengths within the broad field of the house's activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the Five Nations. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together.</p>\n<p>The final blow came in 972 YK. The Order of the Emerald Claw—at the time, an extension of Karrnath's government—was a favored client of the Thuranni family, as well as the most important espionage-related organization in Karrnath's government. Knight Superior Kadrath ir'Vardikk, a high-ranking Emerald Claw officer, came to Lord Elar Thuranni d'Phiarlan with information that pointed to a Brelish plot to assassinate both Karnnath's regent and its young king. The plot relied heavily on the talents of the Paelion line, the most fearsome assassins in House Phiarlan. Sir Kadrath demanded that the Thuranni line eliminate the Paelions before the assassins could carry out their mission.</p>\n<p>At first, Lord Elar was hesitant to strike against his own house. He first tried to verify the information Sir Kadrath had brought him. What the Thuranni agents uncovered, however, was a far greater threat than a simple assassination plot against @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. Lord Tolar Paelion d'Phiarlan, it seemed, had concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the Last War to an end and gather the reins of power in Khorvaire, not in Breland's hands, but in his own. Part of this plan, Lord Elar learned, involved exterminating the other Phiarlan families as well as the leadership of the other dragonmarked houses.</p>\n<p>Some might have dismissed these plans as megalomaniacal ravings presenting little serious threat. Since they originated in the most fearsome line of assassins in all Khorvaire, however, Lord Elar took them utterly seriously, and he ordered an immediate strike to exterminate the Paelions before Lord Tolar could carry out his plan.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/assassination-of-paelion-family.webp\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" /></div>\n<p>Lord Elar himself killed Tolar and his immediate family, while the Thuranni agents at his command slaughtered every Paelion within the family holdings in Lhazaar, and every one they could find in Phiarlan holdings across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Outraged at this apparent betrayal, Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi d'Phiarlan declared the Thuranni line excoriate. Defiant, Lord Elar refused this punishment, instead declaring the formation of a new dragonmarked house. The clients of the Thuranni family continued doing business with the excoriate house, and Elar—now taking the title of Baron—managed to acquire some clients formerly loyal to the Paelion line.</p>\n<p>To this day, Baron Elar d'Thuranni maintains that he acted out of loyalty to his own house and all the dragonmarked houses, quashing a plot that would have thrown all of Khorvaire into even greater upheaval. There are many sides to the story, however, and—as in all tales of espionage—the truth is hard to discern.</p>\n<p>Some would suggest that the Order of the Emerald Claw actually fabricated evidence against the Paelions, bringing some of it to Lord Elar while planting the rest in the Paelion holdings for Elar's spies to uncover. Some further suggest a link between the Emerald Claw's role in the Shadow Schism and Regent Moranna's decision to outlaw the order just four years later.</p>\n<p>Other theories suggest wilder conspiracies. Some claim that human agents of the draconic Chamber helped to bring the schism about in order to fulfill prophetic claims about thirteen houses or the split of a single house. (Many of these theorists further claim that the same Chamber agents are working to prevent @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} from splintering for the same reason.) Others whisper that at least one prisoner in Dreadhold is imprisoned there for his role in fomenting the schism. Still others claim that Lord Elar and Baron Elvinor amicably agreed to a split in the house and used a mutual enemy, the Paelion line, as a scapegoat to cloak their true intentions.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth, the Shadow Schism was the most important consequence of the Last War as far as the dragonmarked houses are concerned.

{"_id":"6qQjbisWdOKLqdMB","name":"Neutrality and Law","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"dragonmarked-header center\"><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\" /> <img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/mark-of-sentinel.webp\" width=\"286\" height=\"300\" />\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p>Neutrality and Law</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Throughout the Last War, Deneith maintained a position of neutrality, serving the whole of Galifar rather than any of its fractured parts. Although this position caused unrest in the house's home of Karrnath, the Deneith patriarch, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Baron Breven d'Deneith} (LN male human aristocrat 3/ fighter 3/dragonmark heir 4), saw the need for a balance of idealism and practicality. Although Deneith's military forces were nearly the equal of any kingdom, joining with one side (likely @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}) would have overwhelmed the house's resources as it was targeted by the other nations.</p>\n<p>As it happened, its neutral position served Deneith well. At the Treaty of Thronehold, the right of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} to maintain a standing military force was recognized once more. Further, it was agreed to allow members of the house to travel unimpeded by national boundaries for the sake of defending the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} against external threats. Before the war, Deneith bodyguards made up a significant portion of the royal retinues of Galifar, services that remained in demand both during the war and after.</p>\n<p>The central philosophy of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} is built upon fulfilling the letter of the law, with contracts and codes governing every action its members take. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Sentinel Marshals} serve an ideal of justice, chasing down criminals no matter where they might hide. For the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Defenders} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks Guilds}, the law of the land is not half as important as the law of their contract, wherein their services are pledged to a nation or individual under specific circumstances and for a specific length of time. No matter what side of the house one falls on, honor, ethics, and an adherence to oaths sworn form the bulk of a Deneith heir's reputation. One who keeps his word and fulfills expectations is valued highly, whether his heart tends to good or evil. One who is unreliable or capricious, on the other hand, will find few friends within the house.</p>\n<h2>Dissent Within the Ranks</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith's} position of military strength and influence in Khorvaire goes largely unchallenged. Though Deneith is not preeminent among the dragonmarked houses, it has never aspired to be. By maintaining its neutrality and refusing ties to any one nation, Deneith has instead become a force that others must rely on.</p>\n<p>Today, however, this reputation of strength and security means less than at any time in Deneith's past. In the aftermath of the Last War, the house is quietly buckling under pressure from within and without, and its resources are strained to a degree that few outside the leadership see.</p>\n<h2>KARRNATH'S CHILDREN</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith's} headquarters is in Karrlakton, and its roots are set deep in Karrnathi soil. The features and temperament of the Karrns can be found at all levels of House Deneith, from Breven d'Deneith to the mercenary captains of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks}. Deneith is proud of its heritage, but the day of reckoning for that birthright might soon be at hand.</p>\n<p>When the Last War began, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} had a good excuse to claim neutrality. It served Galifar, and would continue to do so even without a crowned king or queen. That neutral stance garnered an amount of respect among the Karrns, who were content that Deneith did not serve their king as long as it served no one else.</p>\n<p>Galifar is little more than a memory now, formally dissolved by the Treaty of Thronehold. The king of Karrnath no longer fights for a place upon the Throne of Galifar, but rather clamors for peace among his brethren. In the eyes of many of his people, Kaius III's embrace of peace weakens his land.</p>\n<p>This conflict of ideals is causing unrest in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, and could lead to Kaius's undoing. At the same time, those Karrns who long for battle against the upstart nations of Khorvaire now wonder how Deneith can refuse to fight for its rightful king, especially when they imagine the glories of a shared Deneith–@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} army against the poor remnants of Khorvaire's other nations. Should Kaius III be deposed and Karrnath led again to war, Deneith's much-vaunted neutrality might be put to the test—and the sword.</p>\n<h2>SUPPLY AND DEMAND</h2>\n<p>For centuries, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks Guild} has done business with every major militia and town watch in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, as well as provided security forces for other dragonmarked houses, private citizens, and expeditions across Khorvaire and beyond.</p>\n<p>The Last War changed all this, drastically reducing the available pool of experienced soldiers and mercenaries. It was an unpleasant surprise, then, when @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} entered the mercenary market in the dying days of the war. Deneith had never before encountered competition for its services on any meaningful scale, and for another house to engineer such a challenge with the help of the monstrous races of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} was a bitter insult.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} heirs are human, and humans make up the majority of their forces. Though a smattering of warforged, shifters, and half-elves can be found in Deneith ranks, half-orcs usually prefer to work with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}, and other races are rare. For Deneith's work within the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, human troops were once an advantage, but the outlook in Khorvaire has changed.</p>\n<p>In urban areas such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, civilized monsters can walk the streets without fear as long as they obey the laws of the realm. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} helped to pioneer this change, and its actions have placed the house squarely in Deneith's sights. Deneith is determined to conquer this new mercenary market, either by wresting control from Tharashk or building its own pool of monstrous talent to draw from.</p>\n<p>Neither house admits to any open conflict with the other, but covert clashes occur on a regular basis. If the situation escalates, the rift between the houses might well become irreparable. The dragonmarked houses have traditionally abstained from interfering in intrahouse feuds, but no houses have ever before maintained their own standing armies. Open warfare between Deneith and Tharashk is a prospect few among the dragonmarked care to dwell on.</p>\n<h2>AMBITION'S THRALL</h2>\n<p>Security and ambition are uneasy companions at the best of times. One requires safety, while the other demands risk. Though Deneith's position in Khorvaire is largely secure, some within the house are convinced that security is simply another word for stagnation. They see the house's position and wealth as resources to be spent in a larger plan, not treasures to be hoarded. With its martial strength and established presence across Khorvaire, Deneith could be the equal of any of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the master of all the houses. It could be Galifar reborn.</p>\n<p>Those agitating for change within the house believe that the time for a Deneith dynasty is at hand. The house provides security for the crowned heads of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and a substantial portion of the nobility, as well as important members of the Twelve and the dragonmarked houses. Deneith forces guard Thronehold, with the house holding the throne in stewardship until a new king or queen is crowned. How better to ensure that happens than to seize the crown for themselves?</p>\n<p>Baron Breven d'Deneith is aware of this movement, but calls it madness. Taking the throne and setting House Deneith to rule Khorvaire would necessitate throwing away everything the house has built and stands for. Such action would pit the house against not just the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the other dragonmarked houses, but potentially against the Chamber if the draconic Prophecy were thought to be imperiled. Deneith would be irrevocably ruined—possibly even destroying the Mark of Sentinel as a result.</p>\n<p>Other members of his house do not share Breven's perspective. In particular, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Shirin d'Deneith} (LE male human rogue 3/fighter 4/dragonmark heir 2), a minister within the house, keeps the dark dream of conquest foremost in the thoughts of house members. Though Shirin holds little power from his position alone, he is a charismatic individual. Well spoken and articulate, he has used these gifts to draw like-minded individuals to him. He has also joined the Blood of Vol, using the cult to grant him access to the Order of the Emerald Claw. In doing so, he takes a great risk, since opinion within the house might turn against him if his actions were known. If Shirin has his way, his association with the order will not be discovered until Breven is dead or deposed, and he has seized control of the house.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Organizations in House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{People of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]{House Deneith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith in the World]{House Deneith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Deneith]{Playing a Member of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Neutrality and Law]{Neutrality and Law}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uglugyq15vm","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"7YJWCoJR11OqC22h","name":"Holidays in Sharn","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Holidays in Sharn</h1>\n<p>There's always a celebration happening or about to happen in Sharn, whether it's a parade in a single district or a festival that ranges across the entire city. Here are a few special occasions to put on your calendar.</p>\n<h3>The Tain Gala (First Far of each month)</h3>\n<p>The ir'Tains are the richest and most powerful family in Sharn. Each month, Lady Celyria ir'Tain holds a ball at her Skyway mansion. The guest list defines the current social order of the city; those families who hold permanent invitations, known as the Sixty, are the de facto royalty of Sharn. Celyria does invite unusual guests and attractions each month, and an up-and-coming entertainer or a renowned folk hero might catch her notice.</p>\n<h3>Crystalfall (9 Olarune)</h3>\n<p>During the Last War, saboteurs caused a floating tower to fall into Lower Dura. This devastation can still be seen today in the district now known as Fallen. On 9 Olarune, people gather to remember those who were lost that day. Many of them carry on a tradition of crafting elaborate ice sculptures and throwing them into the Dagger River.</p>\n<h3>The Day of Mourning (20 Olarune)</h3>\n<p>The nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire, this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a brief upturn in violence.</p>\n<h3>Sun's Blessing (15 Therendor)</h3>\n<p>The festival of Dol Arrah is a day of peace and a time when enemies are urged to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts. It's one of the safest days in the city for visitors and residents alike.</p>\n<h3>Aureon's Crown (26 Dravago)</h3>\n<p>Elders share their knowledge with the young during this celebration. Morgrave University holds its graduate services on this day, and a day-long schedule of public lectures is presented at the Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis.</p>\n<h3>Brightblade (12 Nymm)</h3>\n<p>The festival of Dol Dorn is noted across the city with prizefights, wrestling matches, archery contests, and other tests of strength and skill. This activity culminates with a grand contest of champions in the Cornerstone district in Middle Tavick's Landing.</p>\n<h3>The Race of Eight Winds (23 Lharvion)</h3>\n<p>This event is an aerial race that takes place around Dura Quarter.</p>\n<h3>The Hunt (4 Barrakas)</h3>\n<p>In honor of the Sovereign Balinor, a fierce beast is brought to the city and released on this day into an isolated section of Old Sharn. Anyone can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.</p>\n<h3>Fathen's Fall (25 Barrakas)</h3>\n<p>This celebration commemorates a priest of the Silver Flame who was martyred while exposing lycanthropes in Sharn. The day's activities often cause tension with the shifter community.</p>\n<h3>Boldrei's Feast (9 Rhaan)</h3>\n<p>Gatherings across the city mark this celebration of community. The wealthy compete to throw the grandest parties, and the most generous among them will be remembered throughout the year for their largesse.</p>\n<h3>The Ascension (1 Sypheros)</h3>\n<p>The sacrifice of Tira Miron, who gave her life to serve as the Voice of the Silver Flame, is honored on this day. The holiday is marked by services at all Silver Flame churches and shrines, and the faithful are encouraged to find some way to help their communities.</p>\n<h3>Wildnight (18–19 Sypheros)</h3>\n<p>Supposedly the Fury, the god of Passion and Revenge, reaches the height of her power on this night. Emotions run high, and impulse control runs low. Shy and superstitious folk stay indoors, while others see it as a time to cast aside inhibitions. The streets fill with revelry that lasts well into the night.</p>\n<h3>Thronehold (11 Aryth)</h3>\n<p>This observance marks the day that the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, officially ending the Last War. This year (998 YK) is only the second time the event has been commemorated, and the Lord Mayor of Sharn has promised a truly epic festival.</p>\n<h3>Long Shadows (26–28 Vult)</h3>\n<p>It's said that the power of the Shadow, the sinister deity of the Dark Six, is at its height during these three nights. Careful people spend this time indoors with friends, but those who relish the darkness might decide to take to the streets to prey on the weak and foolish.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ggzl5wksbsl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

From aboard his flagship, the powerful and fast <em>Dragoneye</em>, Ryger commands a fleet of twenty ships that can be outfitted as easily for war as for carrying cargo. His port of call, the large town of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, boasts some of the best shops and inns east of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds} and can easily be called the jewel of the Lhazaar Sea. In addition to overcoming the challenges that flare up between the Principalities, Ryger’s fleet proved itself in battle repeatedly during the final decade of the Last War. Pirate, privateer, merchant—Ryger has worn all of these hats and more since wresting the prince’s crown from the head of Horget Black, the previous high prince of the Lhazaar Sea.</p>\n<p>The Seadragons have cultivated a special relationship with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}, acting as a merchant fleet alternative to House Lyrandar shipping. Seadragon merchant ships frequently have Orien couriers amongst their passengers, carrying mail throughout the Principalities. Providing a basic governmental function like the mail has reinforced the Seadragon’s claims of authority.</p>\n<p>The size and success of the Seadragons has formalized their internal hierarchy. Captains usually have tactical autonomy to conduct missions as they see best but defer to Ryger for strategic decisions such as the choice between anti-piracy patrols or engaging in trade. One of the Seadragon’s greatest strengths has been investments in long-range communication magic, so each captain can stay in contact with Ryger on a daily basis. This dynamism has helped the fleet balance priorities between merchant, peacekeeper, and during the war privateer.</p>\n<h3>High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn</h3>\n<p>As high prince, Ryger is seen as a leader among equals, and most of the sea barons and pirate lords bow to his wisdom and counsel (though not yet to his rule). Those who refuse to pay heed to Ryger do so quietly, so as not to attract the attention of his warships and loyal warriors.</p>\n<p>The prince has ruled the Seadragon Principality for fifteen years, and throughout that time he has claimed to have the blood of the Galifar kings running through his veins.

The Thuranni elves bear the Mark of Shadow, and they have the same skills and powers as their Phiarlan cousins. However, House Thuranni is smaller than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} and has fewer resources. This discrepancy gives Phiarlan an edge when it comes to entertainment and information-gathering. But Thuranni is unmatched in one field: assassination. Like the displacer beast they use as their seal, House Thuranni elves are deadly and all but untouchable.</p>\n<p>Though the Mark of Shadow was the first of the dragonmarks to appear, the elves of Thuranni are the youngest of the dragonmarked houses. Like their cousins in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, the Thuranni lead double lives. Known among the general populace as fine artists and courtiers, they are equally well known among the knowledgeable elite as purveyors of secrets and dark deeds. In a short time (especially by elven reckoning), the Thuranni @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} has grown to rival and even eclipse its parent sect, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}. In espionage and undercover work, agents of the new house have as good a reputation as their Phiarlan brethren. In assassination, House Thuranni has a distinct and dangerous edge—one that makes many within the dragonmarked houses uneasy.</p>\n<p>The edicts of Korth demand that the dragonmarked houses maintain strict neutrality with regard to the political concerns of the land. However, the work of espionage is, by its nature, inextricably linked with the affairs of nations and their partisan concerns. For that reason above all others, existing conflicts within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} grew out of control, ultimately leading to House Thuranni's break from the rest of the house in 972 YK—an event now known as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}.</p>\n<h2>House Thuranni Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Organizations in House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]{House Thuranni as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Thuranni]{People of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni in the World]{House Thuranni in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Thuranni]{Playing a Member of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-thuranni-coa.webp\" width=\"264\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>Even though the agents of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are spies and espionage experts, the leaders of the house have always sought to be a force for order and balance. On more than one occasion they helped a rightful heir of Galifar defeat would-be usurpers, and if Queen Mishann had called on the house for help, the Last War might have come to an abrupt end. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} did good business during the war: Every nation needed intelligence. However, this work put the house under tremendous pressure. Shadowmarked elves from different families often found themselves working at cross-purposes, and some lost sight of their neutrality and developed attachments to a particular nation.</p>\n<p>This situation came to a head in 972 YK, when Thuranni assassins turned on another family within House Phiarlan—the Paelion line. The few Paelions who survived this attempt at extermination went into hiding. Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan condemned the action and called for the excoriation of the entire Thuranni family. Elar Thuranni refused to accept this judgment, declaring his family to be a new house. After years of argument, the Twelve agreed, and House Thuranni was born.</p>\n<p>This is the official story of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}, but many questions remain. What triggered the massacre of the Paelions? Elar claims to have uncovered a Paelion plot to assassinate kings and dragon marked barons. But there are those who say that both Elar and Elvinor wanted the split, and used the Paelions as scapegoats. If this is true, what could be the reason?</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War: </strong>For most of the Last War, the Thuranni were part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}. The Thuranni line was concentrated in northwestern Khorvaire and performed much of its work for Karrnath. It worked closely with the Order of the Emerald Claw, and some say that House Thuranni continues to work with the Emerald Claw today.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{Baron Elar d'Thuranni}: </strong>Head of House Thuranni, he is an engimatic figure, driven and charismatic.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p>The Shadow Network has safe houses hidden across Khorvaire, but the major enclaves of House Thuranni are found in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities}.

When @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} established a new Demesne of Shape in Thaliost, House Thuranni renamed its enclave the True Shapers.

When the elves came to the island, they found almost no vegetation; Farlnen is close to the plane of Mabar, and full sunlight never reaches its stony soil. The Grim Lord Varonaen overcame this challenge, and the fruits of his labors can be seen today: darkwood trees and ebon sedge grass that feed on shadows instead of sunlight. Varonaen has continued his work over the course of generations, and the merchants of Farlnen trade spices and wines that cannot be produced anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p>The waters around the island are just as dangerous as the stories say. Basalt columns and treacherous reefs pose inanimate threats to those who don’t know the coastline, and the undead sentinels pose an even greater threat. Anything that roamed the water over the centuries might have been slain at some point and bound to protect Farlnen. Krakens? Dragon turtles? Worse? It’s up to you to decide what lies hidden in the dark water.</p>\n<h3>The Faces of Farlnen</h3>\n<p>Farlnen is a dark reflection of Aerenal. The cities are made of basalt and darkwood, and the sun never pierces the Mabaran haze that hangs over the island. Most of the elves who reside there have pale complexions, as one might expect in such a sunless land. However, children conceived when Mabar is close are sometimes born with jet­black skin; such elves can be mistaken for drow. Tattoos are used both aesthetically and as a sign of status. At a glance, Bloodsail facial tattoos are similar to the death mask designs employed by the Aereni, though the Bloodsails favor crimson inks. But to those who know the culture, these tattoos can reveal family line, mystical talent, and the bearer’s ship.</p>\n<p>Although Bloodsail merchants and privateers are found across the Lhazaar Principalities and the Bitter Sea, strangers receive a cold welcome in Farlnen. Port Cairn is the gateway to the island and the seat of Prince Tasil, but any visitor quickly realizes that the place has few families. It is home to travelers and those who cater to them, but the family estates lie in the interior and the Fingerbone Mountains. Foreigners who want to travel into the interior of Farlnen are treated with suspicion or hostility; it is all but impossible to find a guide unless the traveler is an elf or a follower of the Blood of Vol.</p>\n<p>Farlnen is primarily inhabited by elves, along with a handful of eladrin and half­elves. The eladrin arrived eighteen hundred years ago, fleeing a disaster in Thelanis; they have fully embraced the Bloodsail culture and married into elf families. Members of other races might be accepted as guests, but there is no place for humans on the Black Isle.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_g0qv2btwy4s","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The university owns the buildings in the University District that surrounds the campus proper, renting residences to students and faculty. The university also leases business space to the trades and services that keep the university going, from booksellers and stationers to scribes and cartographers. The university itself fills Dalannan Tower, which is crowned by the enormous dome of Lareth Hall. Five slender spires (representing and named after the Five Nations, Aundair Spire, Breland Spire, Cyre Spire, Karrnath Spire, and Thrane Spire) ring Dalannan Tower and house the university's students. </p>\n<p>At the bottom levels of the university, several large courtyards stretch among the towers, filled with soil carried up from below and seeded with grass and small trees. These courtyards are commonly called the “ground floor” of the campus, despite their being high above the ground of the Menthis Plateau, and they are popular sites for student gatherings, and even class meetings, on the rare occasions that Sharn's notoriously rainy weather lets up. </p>\n<p>Beyond the courtyards, the \"ground floor\" contains most of the lecture halls on campus as well as study halls, sub-libraries (mostly focused on Books of Khorvaire assigned for student reading), dining halls, and some faculty offices.</p>\n<p>Like most educational institutions, Morgrave is a constant bustle of activity while classes are in session but can seem practically deserted in the evenings, on weekends, and between terms. Even for nonstudents, the university contains resources and information helpful to nearly any pursuit, if you know where to look and whom to ask. The following locations represent some of the most popular and versatile resources on the campus.​</p>\n<p>Morgrave University is located in Upper Menthis Plateau, where it occupies the aptly named University district. The university itself occupies the massive Dalannan Tower; this includes a number of layers. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tower is crowned by Lareth Hall, a beautiful domed structure than holds administrative and faculty offices.</li>\n<li>Classrooms and auditoriums occupy Dalannan Proper, the levels directly below the dome.</li>\n<li>The Dezina Museum of Antiquities occupies a number of levels below Dalannan Proper. This showcases many wonders recovered from Xen'drik and other expeditions, though anything truly valuable tends to be sold by the university.</li>\n<li>The Morgrave University Library stretches down below, with levels and levels of stacks below the public reading rooms. While the library has its limits—including a level of disorganization that results in texts being randomly lost in the stacks for decades—it is the most extensive collection in Breland.</li>\n<li>Below the Library lie the Vaults. These hold crates of relics waiting to be catalogued, shelves of oddities deemed to have little monetary or academic value, and a few heavily secured chambers holding artifacts deemed too valuable or dangerous to be put on display. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breland Spire is adjacent to Dalannan Tower and holds the standard student dormitories. The Commons is a large open-air plaza situated atop Breland Spire. This massive rooftop garden serves as a space for reflection, public events, and meals; vendors at the edge of the Commons offer a wide range of culinary options. A wide bridge connects the Commons to Dalannan Proper. One side of this bridge holds little shops and vendors catering to students, while the opposite side is the standard place to display notices of interest to students.​</p>\n<h2>Classes at Morgrave</h2>\n<p>Morgrave's physical education classes cover everything from acrobatics and athletics to archery, dueling, and various other forms of combat. The arcane studies program covers the Arcana skill, as well as honing the abilities of arcane casters. Divine magic can't simply be taught, but Morgrave has classes in theology and religious history—essentially, the Religion skill. </p>\n<p>While these classes may not make for interesting adventures, Morgrave is famous for its hands-on teaching style. This often involves competitions against other students. It can also involve a professor's personal projects: Why don't you come help with this conjuration? Trust me nothing will go wrong. Once students have proven their competence, it can involve expeditions—trips into the Depths of Sharn, or even to distant countries or lands. </p>\n<p>Although Morgrave professors are experts in their fields, this doesn't mean they have all the abilities of high level player characters! Just because that conjuration professor can perform a summoning ritual doesn't mean he can cast fireball. Always remember that player characters are exceptional—and as that talent begins to show, people are sure to take an interest in you.​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_cflz351a55t","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

To the north and east, steep cliffs define the city's boundaries, while deep chasms formed by volcanic action cut the plateau into five distinct regions: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura} on the west, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tavick's Landing]{Tavick's Landing} on the east, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Northedge]{Northedge} to the north, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Menthis Plateau]{Menthis Plateau} in the center. Along the Dagger River at the western edge of the city, the neighborhood of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cliffside]{Cliffside} is built upon and into the steep riverside cliffs. Above the highest towers, the neighborhood of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Skyway]{Skyway} floats over the city. The city also extends underground, into sewers and long-forgotten ruins, and deeper to the furnaces and foundries of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Cogs]{the Cogs}.</p>\n<p>Sharn sits within a manifest zone linked to Syrania, the Azure Sky. This manifest zone enhances magic related to flying and levitation, which makes many of Sharn's magical wonders possible. The vast majority of the magic items used within the city to facilitate flight only function because of the manifest zone, and work less well or not at all beyond its boundaries.</p>\n<p>Most of Sharn's neighborhoods are vertically stratified. For example, while @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Menthis Plateau]{Menthis Plateau} is known as a center of entertainment, the type and quality of entertainment available varies among the different levels of the towers. The upper levels (usually referred to as \"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Menthis]{Upper Menthis}\") offer high art in the forms of opera, theater, and symphony, as well as housing Morgrave University and a thriving community of writers and other artists. The middle levels (\"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Menthis]{Middle Menthis}\") house a thriving theater district with more affordable shows, a large number of professional minstrels, acrobats, and similar entertainers, and a year-round circus complete with animals. The lower levels (\"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Menthis]{Lower Menthis}\") contain a very different sort of theater district marked by burlesque shows, a red light district, and a great number of taverns for cheap and bawdy entertainment.</p>\n<h2>The Shape of Sharn</h2>\n<p>Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of over a million people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.</p>\n<p>Sharn stands above the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it has grown ever upward.</p>\n<p>The city is primarily made up of these quarters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Menthis Plateau]{Menthis Plateau}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Northedge]{Northedge}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tavick's Landing]{Tavick's Landing}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers. A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Skyway]{Skyway} floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Cogs]{the Cogs} stretch out below the lower city.</p>\n<p>In between those extremes, each of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.</p>\n<h2>A Vertical City</h2>\n<p>Sharn rises from five distinct plateaus. While each plateau has its own unique feel and personality, you have to remember that the city also rises vertically into the usually cloud-filled sky. So, while the city is divided into horizontal neighborhoods, it is also divided and stratified vertically.</p>\n<p>Take a typical tower block in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau}. Starting at the uppermost level of the city, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Skyway]{Skyway} floats above the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau's} tallest towers that actually touch the ground. The Upper City sees the most light and enjoys the freshest air, and consequently the most well to do members of society live and work among the skybridges and platforms and balconies that extend from the uppermost towers.</p>\n<p>Dropping down to the next section, we come to the Middle City. This part of the city is a bit more enclosed than the section above it, but there are still open-air balconies and platforms here and there. A wide range of middle-class citizens live and work in this region.</p>\n<p>Descending farther, we arrive in the Lower City, where the poor must toil and struggle to survive. Few windows and only the occasional balcony or skybridge can be found among these levels, where the tower foundations grow close together and seem to merge with each other in ways almost unimagined in the higher sections of the city.</p>\n<p>Beneath the Lower City, the weight of Sharn's towers seems to crush all memories of the Depths. Sewer networks fill the upper regions of the Depths before giving way to the ancient ruins and forgotten levels of earlier ages. Passages and shafts are neglected, and many have collapsed over the centuries, but who knows what wonders and horrors roam these vaults that have been abandoned by those living higher in the city.</p>\n<p>At the very base of the city, beneath ground level, lies the Cogs, whose great foundries and massive forges fuel Sharn's industrial economy. Shafts and tunnels that bypass the Depths lead directly to the Cogs.</p>\n<p>In all, it's hard to tell where one vertical section of the city begins and another one ends, and it certainly isn't a uniform division from one ward to another.</p>\n<h2>Quarters, Wards and Districts</h2>\n<p>The city of Sharn is divided into smaller units: quarters, wards, and districts. The smallest unit is a district. Equivalent to a neighborhood, a district has a population ranging from 18,000 people to over 90,000 in the larger districts of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura}. Businesses of similar types tend to cluster in districts, giving each district a particular character as well as a definite social class (upper, middle, or lower). In general, the most densely populated districts are the lowerclass districts. Examples of districts include @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Highest Towers]{Highest Towers}, the civic center of Sharn, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragoneyes]{Dragoneyes}, a red light district.</p>\n<p>A ward consists of three to nine districts. To an extent, districts of similar type and social class cluster together in wards, though there is some variation in individual wards. The wards of Sharn are grouped vertically as well as horizontally, so there are upper, middle, and lower wards in each area of the city. Upper-class districts tend to be found in upper wards. Examples of wards include the Upper Central Plateau (known simply as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Central]{Upper Central}), which includes Sharn's financial and civic districts, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Tavick's]{Lower Tavick's} Landing, which includes businesses catering to merchants arriving in Sharn by Orien caravan or lightning rail.</p>\n<p>Quarters, the largest divisions of the city, generally consist of three wards apiece and are divided based on the actual topography of Sharn's plateaus. Examples of quarters include the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tavick's Landing]{Tavick's Landing}.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/sharn/sharn-flying-in-sharn-at-night.webp\" /></div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_7v9zhbb6jfa","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Long before they came into their own as masters of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, the dwarves of the Ironroot Mountains were locked in bitter infighting. For some seven thousand years, clan fought against clan over disputed territory, mineral rights, and especially honor. Dwarven pride is strong even today, but in an older age of blood and steel, pride was a way of life—and death.</p>\n<p>Though the origins of the dwarf kingdoms of Khorvaire are lost to history, it is known that a unified dwarf nation once spread deep beneath the Ironroot Mountains. Within this kingdom, it came to pass that twelve warriors were exiled for barbarism and unrest, forced to the surface along with their followers by Lord Kordran Mror. The gateways to the kingdom below were closed off by powerful magic, the dwarves told that they would remain in exile until they had found the honor that their barbarism prevented them from attaining. Alongside the exiles, a clan of wardens was sent to the lands above to watch over these gates—a clan by the name of Kundarak.</p>\n<p>For thousands of years, the exile clans fought among themselves, both for dominance and for the right to return to the kingdom of stone. Even the appearance of the Mark of Warding among the Kundarak clan did nothing to stem the conflict; indeed, it fast became a source of bitterness and distrust among the other clans, who developed no such marks. When Prince Karrn annexed the lands around the mountains for his father King Galifar, the fractious clans were easily subdued.</p>\n<p>As it happened, the dwarves' subjugation by Galifar was their salvation. Forced to set aside their violent ways, the exiles created a common culture and found the honor they had long sought. In the end, though, this understanding came too late. When the heirs of Kundarak opened the sealed gates, the kingdom of stone was gone, destroyed by the daelkyr while the twelve clans made war on each other. However, with their ancient duty to guard the entrances to the lands below discharged, the Kundarak were free to set their sights on greater tasks.</p>\n<p>With the aid of the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the Kundarak clan began its transformation into @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, and it was formally inducted into the dragonmarked houses in 106 YK. By the close of that century, few banking and financial operations on Khorvaire were not under the control or influence of the dwarves of the Mark of Warding. For eight centuries, the once barbaric stonefolk of the mountains worked patiently to establish themselves among the other surface races. When the Last War erupted, the Mror clans declared their independence from Karrnath. Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} has never held a seat on the Iron Council, its support was central to the political will that forged the dwarf nation.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak's} affluence and the power of the Mark of Warding cause the house to be held in high esteem. Its clients depend on the house seal that endorses a Kundarak letter of credit as much as they depend on the power of the arcane lock that protects what that credit can buy. Like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, House Kundarak has a vested interest in remaining (or at least appearing to remain) neutral in its dealings with the other dragonmarked houses, as well as the rulers of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Were this public integrity to be compromised, Khorvaire's entire financial system would suffer.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Organizations in House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{People of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak as an Organization]{House Kundarak as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak in the World]{House Kundarak in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Kundarak]{Playing a Member of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wardens of the Gates]{Wardens of the Gates}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-kundarak-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_cx94dsdsky8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"AEiYVPaRAB4hBMVT","name":"Tidewater Rock","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Tidewater Rock</h1>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<p><strong>Island fortress</strong><br /><strong>Population:</strong> 14</p>\n</div>\n<p>The keep of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tidewater Rock]{Tidewater Rock} sits right on the lagoon’s edge, where the water ranges from knee deep to neck deep, with powerful ebb tides and rip currents that can sweep invaders out to sea.</p>\n<p>Although Tidewater Rock remains a secure base and harbor, it does not command the reputation it once did. The current owner of the Rock is Agasta Smythee, widow of the late Iron Bert. Though Lady Smythee is a competent and formidable figure, without any of her late husband’s ships or network of castles, the Lady of the Rock has fallen upon hard times. Lady Smythee’s forces have been reduced to a small body of loyal guards and a few family retainers whom she employs to eke out a living. The Rock still commands some treasures—its favorable location, its security, and the late captain’s fabled iron shirt from which he gained his nickname—but it is otherwise remote and at the mercy of what the sea chooses to throw upon its shores.</p>\n<h3>History of Tidewater Rock</h3>\n<p>When a Free Captain named Magna Stormeyes discovered the natural harbor on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Windward Isle]{Windward Isle} over 2 centuries ago, she immediately recognized that it would make the perfect haven from which to launch a pirate fleet. Starting with just one ship and a small encampment on Windward’s harbor, she began to ply the trade of piracy. With the plunder from her initial hauls, she set about building a keep, which she called Tidewater Rock. From the vantage point atop the Rock, she found she could pick out particularly ripe targets while receiving ample of warning of hostile ships approaching.</p>\n<p>Over time, Stormeyes’ successes enabled her to build a sizeable fleet, as well as more strongholds on several different islands. She became the scourge of the southern sea lanes and eventually claimed the Hurricane Crown as her own. Shortly after becoming the Hurricane King and relocating to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Verge]{Port Verge}, she was assassinated by rival Free Captains. Stormeyes’ burgeoning fleet fell apart among its squabbling captains. Gerta Frome, first mate of Stormeyes’ flagship, the Cocksure, seized control of the Rock. Within only a few years, Frome became a powerful Free Captain herself, and the legend of Tidewater Rock as both a powerful good luck talisman and an impregnable bastion was born.</p>\n<p>Over the many years since, control of Tidewater Rock has passed from hand to hand, and its strategic location and practical defensibility have enabled its owners to enrich themselves substantially. With the rebellion of Sargava and its ostensible alliance with the Free Captains, Tidewater Rock became of less strategic importance, and its owners came to be of less prominence, but the age-old axiom of “Good fortune and sure sail await what one can crack the Tidewater Rock” has stood the test of time among the pirates of the Shackles and is oft-quoted—if seldom heeded—even today.</p>\n<p>The most recent lord of Tidewater Rock was Bertram Smythee, captain of the Vale and three other brigs. Like his predecessors, he held Tidewater Rock as his seat, but controlled a few other small castles on surrounding islands as well.</p>\n<p>Over a decade ago, “Iron Bert” Smythee went to sea with his small fleet in a feud with Free Captain Carola Antiochus and was never seen again. Word came back that Antiochus had lured Smythee into the edges of the Eye of Abendego and ambushed him with the help of a previously unknown ally—one Mike Rockface—and that Smythee’s fleet was cut to pieces between the enemy fleets.</p>\n<p>Though Captain Smythee managed to sink Antiochus’s Pergador, he was last seen on the deck of the crippled and sinking Vale at the mercy of the Eye’s hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>Prince Rockface claimed the remainder of Antiochus’s fleet and took control of several of Smythee’s undefended castles. He made an attempt to take the Tidewater Rock as well, only to discover that Smythee’s able widow had taken charge of its defenses. She managed to fend off his attack with such alacrity that Prince Rockface decided to leave the widow to rot in her tower.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Its people are driven and aggressive, determined to find new ways to increase the strength of their young house.</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE THARASHK</h2>\n<p>The clans of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} were formed by the union of orc and human cultures, and have grown alongside the half-orc culture that rose between them. Family ties are important to the people of Tharashk, and marriage is generally the only way to enter the house. Tharashk is willing to embrace any who share its values, particularly orcs who cannot bear the Mark of Finding but whose strength and bravery are a cornerstone of the house's mercantile success. Tharashk even accepts members of other races into its ranks, albeit rarely.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orc}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Orc]{orc}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} by blood or marriage.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Heirs of Tharashk live hard lives and are encouraged to develop a diverse range of skills. Experts are common throughout the house, as are rangers (often found in the Marches) and rogues (predominant among heirs raised in the cities). Tharashk's wide-ranging ambitions can find a use for characters of almost any class, including barbarian, scout, and fighter. Even aristocrats can be found serving as mediators for mercenary contracts in the larger centers of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The house has few wizards or artificers, but a strong tradition of sorcery runs through the clans. Rumors also abound of warlocks among the Aashta clan, attuned to the power of the Dragon Below. The house has a small corps of adepts, along with a handful of druids who follow the traditions of the Gatekeepers. These mystics often work with prospectors to protect and restore the land.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE Tharashk BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} is notoriously tightfisted with its resources, and provides little in the way of material benefits to its heirs. Even so, family members go out of their way to help their kin.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Tharashk heirs provide their services to relatives for 25% of the normal cost, if they charge at all. Tharashk spellcasters also cast 1st-level to 3rd-level spells at no charge for members of their clan (within reason). Heirs of a different clan will typically pay 50% of the normal cost of spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The house's relationship with monstrous nations can also prove a benefit. A recognized agent of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} often receives a friendly reaction in Droaam, or from other groups that work with the Dragonne's Roar. At the same time, a Tharashk adventurer with a reputation as a gnoll- or ogre-slayer poses a threat to the work of the Roar, and might be censured by the house.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]{Organizations in House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Tharashk]{People of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk as an Organization]{House Tharashk as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk in the World]{House Tharashk in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Tharashk]{Playing a Member of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Born of Two Bloods]{Born of Two Bloods}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-tharashk-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9utyvuryl06","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

For centuries, the Kundaraks guarded the sealed gates between the surface world and the dwarf empire to prevent the exiles' return.</p>\n<p>The Mark of Warding emerged about 2,500 years ago, shortly before Karrn the Conqueror seized what is now the Mror Holds and subjugated the exiled dwarf clans. With the Kundaraks' consent, the sealed gates were opened. But the empire was gone, destroyed by the daelkyr. This tragic discovery meant that the Kundaraks' task was finished. With the aid of the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sty0ptLPPXcHrRN2]{Zilargo} and of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, the Kundaraks became a full-fledged dragon marked house in 106 YK.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> House Kundarak's involvement with the Last War was financial rather than military. Twenty years after the Last War began, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds} declared their independence from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}; thanks to an immediate financial infusion from House Kundarak, the dwarves were able to make their independence stick. When years of war turned into decades, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} became increasingly cash-strapped and turned to House Kundarak for hard currency to pay, provision, and equip their armies. The Treaty of Thronehold guaranteed that the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} would make good on their wartime obligations. Not only is House Kundarak among the wealthiest of the dragon marked houses, but it has a ongoing source of income.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{Baron Morrikan d'Kundarak}: </strong>Marrikan has ruled the house for more than a century, the only head of a dragonmarked house that remembers life before the Last War.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Korunda Gate:</strong> High in Kundarakhold, in the Ironroot Mountains, the largest enclave of House Kundarak is home to Lord Morrikan d'Kundarak and nearly 20,000 dwarves. Although the house's wealth is spread out across Khorvaire, more of it resides in the underground vaults below Korunda Gate than anywhere else. But Korunda Gate holds more than rooms full of gold and platinum. Its armories and weapon arsenals contain spectacular examples of both mundane craftsmanship and magical potency.</p>\n<p><strong>The Deep Mine:</strong> This mining operation in the mountains of northern @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} is a collaboration between House Kundarak, Clan Mroranon (possibly the best miners and smelters in Khorvaire), @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} (which found the site in the first place), and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} (which handles relations with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} government). This mine extracts pure platinum from veins more than a mile below the surface. Clan Mroranon's smiths make ingots of the platinum bullion, which House Kundarak uses as internal currency when transferring wealth from a Kundarak bank to a national government or to another Kundarak bank. Security is omnipresent, both to prevent theft by surface dwellers and because the miners sometimes disturb monsters from the depths of Khyber.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/house-kundarak-vault.webp\" width=\"800\" height=\"783\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-kundarak-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_cx94dsdsky8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Explorers who have dared the heights report that the rock faces are almost uncomfortably warm day and night, and snow falls from the heavy clouds but melts immediately rather than accumulating. Water pours down the cliffsides during rains or snows, and flash flooding would be a real danger if not for the many crevasses the water flows into.

The house administers two guilds—the Defenders Guild and the Blademarks Guild—as well as the order of the Sentinel Marshals. Active participation in one guild over the course of an individual's career is mandatory; serving in both is commonplace. Deneith views the guilds as the cornerstone of its mission to protect Khorvaire from its enemies, both within and without.</p>\n<h2>Blademarks Guild</h2>\n<p>The Blademarks Guild is a mercenary branch of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}. It employs mercenaries from across Khorvaire (some associated with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}; some independent contractors), and guarantees both a high level of professionalism and steady work for its hirelings. Deneith's leadership often arises from within the guild, and the Blademarks are considered the core of the house's financial success.</p>\n<p>Most ambitious members of the house spend a year or two serving as soldiers in the Blademarks Guild. The guild has fewer soldiers than it did five years ago, to be sure, but those blademarks under contract are as busy as ever. The end of the war just meant that the blademarks were available to be hired by entities other than armies in the field, such as other dragon marked houses, local nobles, and countries beyond the Five Nations.</p>\n<h2>Defenders Guild</h2>\n<p>The Defenders Guild is a mercenary branch of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}. It consists of veterans of the Blademarks Guild, most of whom have at least one year of successful service behind them. The Defenders Guild contains a far greater percentage of dragonmarked heirs than either the Blademarks or the Sentinel Marshals. Its members are well respected within the house, and considered to be a vital part of Deneith's mission to defend Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Sentinel Marshals</h2>\n<p>Like many dragon marked houses, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} won major dispensations in the Treaty of Thronehold. Perhaps the most important was confirmation that even though Galifar is gone, Deneith's Sentinel Marshals can still pursue criminals across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Operating out of Sentinel Tower in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, marshals work alone or in small groups to apprehend Khorvaire's greatest criminals. And Khorvaire is replete with war criminals, many of which have protection or influence in their home countries . . . until a Sentinel Marshal appears.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Organizations in House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{People of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]{House Deneith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith in the World]{House Deneith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Deneith]{Playing a Member of House Deneith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Neutrality and Law]{Neutrality and Law}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uglugyq15vm","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

There's always a better way to do things.</p>\n</div>\n<p>When the exiles were driven from the Realm Below, it was Soranath who made them weapons. Clan Soranath is one of the smallest clans, but its influence reflects the talents of its artisans. Other clans have mines and fields—it’s Soranath who takes what they produce and makes wonders.</p>\n<p>Not all artisans are from Soranath, just as not all of the denizens of Soranathhold are artisans. Most blades in Mroranonhold are forged by Mroranon smiths. But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won’t change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.</p>\n<p>Soranathhold is small, with only three spires. Its families are tightly knit, and the divide between tenant and clan is a thin line. Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn’t dependent on Tharashk, but doesn’t seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting. However, they are artisans, not warriors; they must hire others to venture into Sol Udar on their behalf.</p>\n<p>The Soranath dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, especially to Onatar; they are quick to assign credit for any great work to the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. There may also be a cult of the Traveler within Soranath, perhaps in Grayroot Spire; if so, it keeps its true devotion well hidden.</p>\n<p>Soranath dwarves are generally guild artisans, acolytes, or sages. Artificers (primarily Battle Smiths) and clerics of the Forge are both logical classes for Soranath dwarves.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The opera house consists of a grand auditorium in Dalannan Tower, with comfortable seating for 3,000 people. As with the Kavarrah Concert Hall, attending performances in the Sharn Opera House usually become very formal affairs, but the opera house also offers standing-room galleries for those of less wealthy means.​</p>\n<h3>Stargazer Theater</h3>\n<p>Another of Upper Menthis Plateau's four theaters, the Stargazer Theater is located on the top of Kelsa Spire, open to the sky. A grassy park surrounds the open-air amphitheater, allowing audience members to picnic on the lawn if they prefer. Once confined to the summer months, its performance season was extended to the whole year thanks to the weather-controlling powers of House Lyrandar. Now, audiences can enjoy the warmth of a spring or summer day whenever they visit the Stargazer. Its repertoire focuses on classics with family appeal.​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_cflz351a55t","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"BoIuC2QeYzXSOuYV","name":"Taer Lian Doresh","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Taer Lian Doresh</h1>\n<p>Thousands of years ago, one of the eladrin's feyspires, Shae Tirias Tolai, slipped from The lanis into Xen'drik— but when it appeared, the giants were waiting. They pillaged the feyspire, claiming its treasures and taking its people as slaves. The other eladrin lords responded by improving their defensive magic. However, some among them wanted more—they sought vengeance.</p>\n<p>The lords of Shae Doresh, the Spire of Dreams, swore to make the giants pay. They transformed their settlement into a mighty fortress, crafting arms, armor, and powerful spells of battle. When their feyspire next appeared in Eberron, they challenged the emperor of the giants, but they had woefully underestimated the power of the titan king. With a powerful ritual, he banished the feyspire to the plane of Dal Quor, where it remained trapped until the cycle of that plane spat it back to Thelanis once more.</p>\n<p>By the time Shae Doresh next returned to Eberron, the giants had been laid low. However, the fey had been tainted by their long sojourn in Dal Quor, their feyspire transformed into a haven for nightmares—now called Taer Lian Doresh, the Fortress of Fading Dreams.</p>\n<p>Like all the other feyspires, Taer Lian Doresh has continued to drift between Thelanis and Eberron. With each cycle, the fey of the Fading Dream nurture their anger for their own dark transformation. They hunt and kill all who stray too close to their citadel. They despise other eladrin for being weak, and consider the elves to be a debased mockery better wiped away.</p>\n<p>The spire exists in a state of flux, simultaneously on Dal Quor and Eberron. Within the fortress, adventurers can meet and physically interact with the spirits of dreamers or quori—though anyone who leaves the spire returns to the plane he or she came from. The Lord of the Fading Dream is no servant of the Dreaming Dark, but he is willing to work with the quori when doing so will spread sorrow across the land.</p>\n<h3>Fortress of Fading Dreams Lore</h3>\n<p><strong>Arcana:</strong> The stories of the feyspires speak of seven cities, including Shae Doresh, the Spire of Dreams. Though this ancient settlement was once a place of beauty and dreams made real, a darkness dwells there now that even the eladrin do not speak of.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcana:</strong> Tales say that the fey of Shae Doresh fought the giants of Xen'drik and were banished to Dal Quor for thousands of years. When they returned, they had become a dark and bitter folk, hungry for vengeance. Their feyspire became known as Taer Lian Doresh, the Fortress of Fading Dreams.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcana with a raise:</strong> Rumors tell of how the fey of the Fading Dream can make nightmares manifest in the material world, unleashing horrific dreams and visions upon their foes.</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>The fey of the Fading Dream are under the command of a brooding king. They have agents across Khorvaire, but most of the host attends him in the dark citadel.</p>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> The fey of the fortress are led by Shan Lian Doresh. He rarely leaves his feyspire, watching the world through the dreams of innocents and destroying lives with whispered secrets and terrible visions.</p>\n<p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> The Fortress of Fading Dreams is hidden deep in the Whitepine Forest. Touched by Dal Quor, the feyspire is a vision from nightmare, and no two people perceive it in the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>Hierarchy: </strong>Once a ghaele of winter, Doresh is the unquestioned ruler of the Fading Dream. Seven Knights of Terror serve him, each of which embodies a particular primal fear. The shrouded sages, led by the night hag Santyriana, are the mystics of the fey.</p>\n<p><strong>Members:</strong> The host of the Fading Dream are eladrin, but fey of other sorts live within the fortress, from sinister gnomes to night hags and far darker creatures. Additionally, the eladrin of the feyspire have recruited allies in the wider world—warlocks who have made pacts with the power of the Fading Dream, or others willing to serve for the lure of fey gold.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Unlike the Ghallanda halflings, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} long ago shifted its focus from the ways of tribal life to the cosmopolitan traditions of central Khorvaire. Today, Jorasco halflings have little or no connection to the ways of their nomadic ancestors, and are firmly entrenched in the lifestyle of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} has long been established as the preeminent source of healing in Khorvaire, having skillfully pushed the temples of the Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame out of the healing business centuries ago. The advent of the Last War saw Jorasco healers spread across the length and breadth of the continent. Remaining steadfastly neutral allowed the house to serve all sides in that conflict, providing mundane care for soldiers and magical healing for the officers who directed the war. Jorasco healers assisted in important military operations and engaged in joint missions with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, offering respite and healing for the wounded—away from the front lines.</p>\n<p>Even after the Last War's end, Jorasco still reaps the benefits of that dark conflict. Those who were broken in battle require a lifetime's care now that the war is over—and such care is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco's} specialty. Since the end of the war, the house has expanded the number of enclaves and healing houses it runs by nearly a third, including opening state-financed centers for veterans of the Last War in each nation.</p>\n<h2>The Price of Healing</h2>\n<p>Initially, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} was the Jorasco tribe, a collection of related family lines. Eschewing the battle-hardened traditions of the Talenta tribes, Jorasco halflings earned their keep through their skills at healing: from midwifery, to patching up wounded warriors, to helping ease the dying along their way. Their skill would be paid for by the recovering individual's family or tribe, an exchange of gifts and services that was the expected convention of Talenta culture.</p>\n<p>When the tribe became a house, the dynamic changed. In founding the house and establishing its headquarters in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, Jorasco soon found itself in debt to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}—debt that called for Jorasco's services to be repaid in coin, not kind. In time, the healers of Jorasco were operating on a set schedule of fees and asking for payment in advance.</p>\n<p>This initial fee schedule was designed to support the healers of Jorasco in return for the time they spent caring for others. As the house became more successful, however, payment became less about survival and more about profit. The Korth Edicts codified this situation in a way, preventing the houses from owning land and forcing them to focus their fortunes in gold alone. Since that time, Jorasco's mission of healing has always been balanced by the house's passion for profit, a reality that angers those most in need of Jorasco's gifts.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Jorasco]{Organizations in House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{People of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco as an Organization]{House Jorasco as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco in the World]{House Jorasco in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Jorasco]{Playing a Member of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Worlds Apart]{Worlds Apart}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-jorasco-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5h9u5zh9ys4","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"BxeArxxpVhCQj4bD","name":"The Wonders of Cyre","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Wonders of Cyre</h1>\n<p>Cyre was a land of wonders, but it’s now lost to the Mournland, leaving Cyrans with only memories. Some of its most renowned marvels stood in Metrol, including . . .</p>\n<h2>the Vermishards</h2>\n<p>Seven spires rise up from Metrol, a natural (or supernatural) wonder. These plateaus held the ancestral homes of the noble lines of old Metrol with the Royal Vermishard the seat of the Cyran crown. However, over centuries, other powers—such as House Cannith and House Phiarlan—made their way to the Vermishards as well. Cannith and Phiarlan worked together with Cyran magewrights to embed illusory lighting into the Vermishards, their glittering spires becoming a remarkable part of the Metrol skyline.</p>\n<h2>The Wynarn InsTITuTe of arT</h2>\n<p>The Wynarn Institute was both one of the foremost academies of magic in Khorvaire and one of its most amazing museums, exploring the artistic potential of the arcane. Treasures of the pre-Galifar kingdoms were displayed here along with modern works of art. In addition to purely artistic exhibits, the Hall of Kings allowed visitors to converse with illusory replicas of the past rulers of Galifar. Though some cultures preserve their rulers so they can advise successors—such as the Aereni elves in chapter 3 and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal in chapter 4—the illusions of the Hall of Kings were merely a tourist attraction.</p>\n<h2>The VaulT</h2>\n<p>The Royal Treasury of Galifar was commonly known as the Vault. While there were reserves hidden around the kingdom, the Vault included both the mint, Cyre’s primary reserves of currencies and precious metals, and important cultural artifacts deemed too valuable to be displayed. Salvagers have dreamed of finding this “Golden Palace,” but there are some stories saying that the Vault no longer remains where it was built, but is actually missing. The Mourning had strange effects on Metrol, and it’s possible the Vault was simply physically displaced, or it could have fallen into another plane.</p>\n<h2>The CaThedral of The soVereIgn hosT</h2>\n<p>Following the spread of the Church of the Silver Flame in Thrane, the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host became the primary seat of Vassal devotion on Galifar. Many of the rulers of Galifar would build an addition to the Cathedral as a way of showing their piety. By the reign of King Jarot, it was a wonder indeed. Nine colossal statues encircled the temple, illusory displays within depicted scenes from the faith, and it held a vast collection of relics and artifacts. The fate of the Cathedral and its treasures remains unknown.</p>\n<h2>Countless Wonders</h2>\n<p>These wonders just scratch the surface of what was possible. Aundair had floating towers; Cyre expanded on this with floating gardens, flower petals falling on the wind to the cities below. Even small towns had crystal theaters where audiences could scry on the great performances in the Demesne of Shape. There was always music in the air and lights in the sky. With this in mind, feel free to create wonders of your own imagination. Cyre was the seat of House Cannith and House Phiarlan, second only to Aundair in arcane sophistication. What your dreams imagine, their hands could create. And even if they didn’t create the things you dream of, people might believe that they did, as the legends of Cyre only continue to grow now that the kingdom is lost.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_xx0xvw5uv7q","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

A traveling band of scouts and bards raised morale and brought news and information to the scattered tribes. They called themselves \"phiarlans,\" an Elven word that translates roughly as \"spirit keepers.\"</p>\n<p>When the elves founded the island nation of Aerenal, the Phiarlans traveled between the city-states as troubadours and mediators. Sometimes mediation worked, but the Phiarlans also learned the power of passing information to the right people. With the rise of the Undying Court, they served the Sibling Kings as spies in an effort to help maintain order in the land.</p>\n<p>Then the dragon marks appeared. Though their nature was a mystery, it was clear that they were connected to the Draconic Prophecy—and the dragons had long been enemies of Aerenal. Suspicion fell upon the dragon marked and grew worse when it was shown that the line of Vol (bearers of the Mark of Death) were allied with dragons. Fearful that they might share Vol's fate, the Phiarlans fled to Khorvaire, where they joined to become House Phiarlan. Their artistic skills earned them a place in the Five Nations, and in time the Serpentine Table offered its services to those in power there.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> During the Last War, House Phiarlan served every nation in the conflict. As the war raged on, however, different family lines within the house developed conflicting loyalties and found themselves working at cross-purposes. The resulting @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism} split the house, resulting in the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} and the near extermination of the Paelion family.

It was a land scarred by the ancient conflict with the daelkyr, where the descendants of the first Gatekeepers and those corrupted by the touch of Xoriat continued to battle in the darkness. Fifteen hundred years ago, humans came to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}: refugees from the distant land of Sarlona fleeing the growing power of the Inspired. Though many of the orcs of the Marches met the first waves of settlers with hostility, a handful of tribes welcomed these strangers. Over time, this union of cultures produced both the clans of the modern age and the jhorgun'taal: “children of two bloods,” or half-orcs.</p>\n<p>When the Mark of Finding appeared among the clans five centuries later, it was carried by humans and half-orcs alike. Some considered this to be a divine gift to the humans and half-bloods to make up for their physical frailty—a magic mark in lieu of the great strength and dark-piercing eyes that Eberron had granted the orcs. The mark appeared among three clans—Aashta, Velderan, and Torrn—and over the next five centuries, the hunters of these clans would become legends within the Marches.</p>\n<p>In 498 YK, expeditions from central Khorvaire reached the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}. One such expedition was led by Zil gnomes, who had calculated that the distant land might hold rich deposits of dragonshards. In this, they were correct, but the discovery of the Mark of Finding was an even greater treasure.</p>\n<p>The clan leaders were cunning and capable, but the Sivis emissaries were intent on working with the Marchers, not exploiting them. With the assistance of the gnomes, the three great clans and their lesser kin joined together to form @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}, an Orc word meaning “united.” For the symbol of the house, the first Triumvirate chose the dragonne, touched with the power of dragons and a fierce hunter in the legends of both Marcher orcs and Sarlonan humans.</p>\n<p>Tharashk was founded on the dragonshard trade, its dragonmarked heirs employing the Mark of Finding to locate shard fields while their unmarked kin extracted those shards. The clan leaders were ambitious, however, and not content to remain in the shadows. Over the last three centuries, the house has spread across the world.

The DM should use these as guidelines if he wishes to expand the list.</p>\n<h2>CRIMES OF AGGRESSION</h2>\n<p>Some of the most serious crimes under the law are those actions that bring direct, physical harm to another person.</p>\n<h3>Assault and Battery</h3>\n<p>The consequences of unarmed brawling depend on class. In lower class districts, the law completely ignores brawling. An innkeeper may throw a rowdy barbarian out of the inn, but the guards simply don't have time to follow up on every bar fight.</p>\n<p>In a middle-class neighborhood, the consequences depend on who is involved in the fight. If two laborers get into a fight, the guards don't care—but if a seedy adventurer punches a respectable barrister, that's another story. Officers of the Watch break up any fight involving respectable citizens. This is a minor offense that can be handled by a sergeant of the Watch. A mark is made on the identification papers of the guilty party. He is fined 5 sp for each assault charge shown on his papers. Finally he is escorted out of the district and ordered to stay away for at least one day. If the character doesn't have gold or identification papers, he is taken to the local garrison and assigned to labor detail. Generally guards do not investigate any sort of assault that they did not personally observe.</p>\n<p>An upper-class district follows the same guidelines as middle-class. There are more guards on the streets of an upper-class neighborhood, so a brawl is more likely to be spotted and stopped.</p>\n<h3>Armed Assault</h3>\n<p>Once people start inflicting lethal damage on one another, a brawl becomes more serious. Guards rarely investigate armed assault in lower-class areas, provided that both parties survived (if not, it's murder). But they certainly do break up fights that they observe and fine the aggressors. The fine increases to 10 gp per offense, and a character with three or more marks on his record may be sent to the garrison and held for trial. It is also common policy to confiscate the weapon of the aggressor, which could be a far more serious loss to a high-level adventurer.</p>\n<h3>Assaulting an Officer</h3>\n<p>Attacking an agent of the law is always a bad idea, and anyone captured after such a battle is held for trial.</p>\n<h3>Murder</h3>\n<p>Murder—the theft of life—is a serious offense. A murderer who is taken by the Watch is held for trial, and execution is certainly a possible punishment. However, this assumes that anyone reports the crime, and that the guards consider it worth the time to investigate. Self-defense is a strong mitigating factor; if the party is attacked by a group of Daask gnolls and kills them, the Watch won't try to track them down and hold them accountable. Likewise, the identity of the victim plays a major role in determining punishment. The murder of a city councilor likely results in execution; the death of a goblin gambler probably never reaches court.</p>\n<h3>Dueling</h3>\n<p>There is a long tradition of dueling in Khorvaire, especially in Karrnath and Thrane. In adventurers' quarters, duels are taken quite seriously; people help the combatants find a safe place to duel, and people who refuse what is seen as a valid challenge suffer a significant loss of face in the district. Most duels are fought to first blood (10% of a duelist's hit points) or until a combatant chooses to yield, but duels to the death are not unheard of.</p>\n<p>However, the Galifar Code of Justice provides no exceptions for dueling. The Sharn Watch considers duels to be assault with two guilty parties, potentially armed assault or even murder depending on the nature of the duel and whether it is interrupted in time.</p>\n<p>While most duels are centered on combat, duels based around displays of skill or magical prowess also occur. Thieves may select a single wealthy target and see who can steal the richest jewel without being noticed.</p>\n<h2>CRIMES OF DECEPTION</h2>\n<p>Deception is stock in trade for criminals, almost a prerequisite for any other sort of crime. In some cases, however, the deception itself is the crime.</p>\n<h3>Forgery</h3>\n<p>Counterfeit coins and false identification papers are the most common forms of forgery, but there are many others. For minor offenses, a guard simply confiscates the counterfeit goods and applies a fine with a value appropriate to the damage caused by the crime. Using forged identification papers carries a standard fee of 10 gp. Participation in a counterfeiting ring or forgery of a more serious nature results in the character being held for trial, with major fines, branding, and exile as possible punishments.</p>\n<h3>Fraud</h3>\n<p>Technically, fraud is “deliberate deception with the intent to cause injury to another.” This covers a wide array of crimes, from oath breaking to selling false goods to what the Galifar Code of Justice calls “Counterfeit of Identity with Criminal Intent”— a charge typically brought against changelings.</p>\n<p>There are a few factors that determine the degree to which the Sharn Watch pursues a fraud investigation. First, how much damage was done? The guards won't bother with a charlatan selling supposed beholder eggs for 5 cp apiece, but a false alchemist selling worthless “healing potions” for 750 gp may run into trouble. If some form of concrete damage cannot be shown, the case certainly won't be investigated.</p>\n<p>The next questions that need to be answered are where the crime took place and who was involved. Scams that occur in the lower wards are rarely investigated; people who stay in Dragoneyes or Hostelhome are asking for trouble. And as is usually the case in Sharn, the guards typically protect the wealthy at the expense of the poor.</p>\n<p>Cases of fraud generally need to be resolved in court; fines, branding, or exile are the usual punishments.</p>\n<h3>Slander</h3>\n<p>Currently, slander is not a crime under the Galifar Code of Justice. If a bard pens a satirical song about Kalphan Riak, he won't have a lawsuit on his hands, though he might have to deal with the wrath of the merchant prince.</p>\n<h2>CRIMES OF PROPERTY</h2>\n<p>It is far more common for criminals to steal, harm, or smuggle property than people. Crimes of property are both more common in the city and less serious under the law.</p>\n<h3>Theft</h3>\n<p>Theft is the most common form of crime in Sharn. It's said that every minute someone picks a pocket or cuts a purse, though this is undoubtedly an exaggeration. For minor offenses where the stolen property is returned, the thief must pay the victim twice the value of what he stole. If the item cannot be returned, the fine may rise as high as ten times the value of the item that was lost, with hard labor if the fine cannot be paid. Branding and exile are common punishments for repeat offenders.</p>\n<h3>Smuggling and Contraband</h3>\n<p>Characters who sell or possess prohibited goods can find themselves in trouble with the law. Typically, contraband goods are confiscated and the criminal is ordered to pay a fine of up to twice the value of the contraband. Large smuggling operations may result in greater fines, along with branding and exile.</p>\n<h3>Treasure Hunting</h3>\n<p>Under the Galifar Code of Justice, it is illegal to plunder and sell the relics of past civilizations for personal gain. So, treasures recovered from Xen'drik, the Depths, or similar locations are actually contraband goods, and the Wharf Watch searches all vessels returning from Xen'drik for treasures.</p>\n<p>There are a few ways that adventurers can avoid having their hard-won treasures confiscated. If they wish to work within the law, they can purchase a letter of marque from the Wharf Watch. A letter of marque costs 500 gp and lasts for one year. A letter of marque covers a single region, such as Breland or Xen'drik.</p>\n<p>When an adventurer attempts to sell recovered goods or passes through customs, he must produce a valid letter of marque for the region where he obtained the recovered goods. Characters who wish to keep these treasures must purchase a record of legal acquisition, a notarized resilient document that provides a brief description of the object and its owner; a single record can describe up to six different objects.</p>\n<p>The need for letters of marque is one reason that adventurers may seek patrons to sponsor their expeditions; Morgrave University has standing letters of marque for almost anywhere adventurers might go. However, an adventurer could choose to avoid the law altogether. Fences throughout Cliffside and the city are happy to make contraband treasures go away, and a good forger can produce letters of marque at a far more reasonable price (typically 25 gp). An adventurer found using forged letters of marque is fined 1,000 gp and blacklisted by the Wharf Watch, which prevents him from acquiring letters of marque in the future.</p>\n<h2>MISUSE OF MAGIC</h2>\n<p>The Galifar Code of Justice includes strict guidelines for the use of magic, as laid down by the Arcane Congress in ages past. These include the following:</p>\n<p>Use of any spell that can inflict physical harm on another being—from magic missile to finger of death—is considered to be armed assault. This includes spells that permanently incapacitate a target, such as flesh to stone. Careless use of fire magic is treated especially harshly, due to the significant threat of property damage. If a summon spell conjures a dangerous creature that harms another person, the conjurer is liable for the actions of the beast.</p>\n<p>Spells that incapacitate a target—such as sleep— are treated as simple assault.</p>\n<p>Spells that tamper with the thoughts of another being—charm person, suggestion, fear—are considered to be a form of fraud.</p>\n<p>There are also a few more obscure laws. House Ghallanda has the sole right to make use of heroes' feast or Leomund's secure shelter within the city limits. Rope trick and Leomund's tiny hut can only be used in private rooms. Knock can only be used by or on behalf of the legal owner of the locked item.</p>\n<p>The problem with magical crimes is that the burden of proof falls on the accuser. Can she prove that she was charmed? The Blackened Book only investigates high-profile cases that have resulted in major damages. Otherwise, if spell use cannot be proven, the crime is not prosecuted.</p>\n<p>The forces of the law are authorized to use any form of magic in pursuit of their duties.</p>\n<h2>TREASON</h2>\n<p>The accusation of treason against the Brelish Crown or the city of Sharn is a serious matter. The Guardians of the Gate handle the investigation of treason, and the King's Citadel generally becomes involved if the accusation is serious. Treasonous behavior can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conspiracy to harm a city official or member of the Brelish Parliament or Royal Court.</li>\n<li>Conspiracy to steal or damage property of the Crown or the government of Sharn.</li>\n<li>Espionage on behalf of a foreign government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these are the most common categories, the agents of the King's Citadel can extend the umbrella of treason to cover any activity they see as threatening the security of Breland. Crimes of Treason are tried under the authority of the King's Citadel, without access to a jury. Depending on the magnitude of the crime, treason can result in exile, indefinite imprisonment, or even execution.</p>\n<h2>LOCAL LAWS</h2>\n<p>Occasionally individual districts or wards have their own laws. Upper Tavick's Landing has a substantial set of local laws.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6l2u8fsp5zw","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"CW2X2YkvVV9H7gwa","name":"Jhorash'tor","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Jhorash'tor Orcs</h1>\n<p>The Jhorash’tar are an alliance of orc tribes that have dwelt in the Ironroot Mountains since before the arrival of the dwarves. The Jhorash’tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror—a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror— implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash’tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.</p>\n<p>The Jhorash’tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains—often in caves along canyon walls— while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash’tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster—their spiritual leader—advises it.</p>\n<p>The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash’tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don’t create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a cleric with the Grave domain (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), though the typical bonecaster doesn’t have access to all the spells and features of a cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be an Ancestral Guardian or Zealot barbarian (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything). The Jhorash’tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.</p>\n<p>The Jhorash’tar don’t work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it’s also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor’s bone. The Jhorash’tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a breastplate or scale mail.</p>\n<p>Many of the Jhorash’tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don’t want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn—but it’s possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.</p>\n<p>It’s up to the DM whether the Jhorash’tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash’tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The Shadow whispers that there is no common good—all that matters is what you need and what you can do. Why should you make sacrifices for others instead of doing what’s best for yourself? Why should you give when you can take?</p>\n<p>The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition. Those who revere it view this as a positive trait; the Shadow will show you how to be the best you can be. But how far will you go in pursuit of your ambition? What—or who—will you sacrifice? Priests who embrace this aspect of the Shadow call themselves Mentors, emphasizing that they can show you how to achieve your full potential; others call them Tempters, as they will always drive you down the darkest path. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Shadow consumes the souls of those who fall prey to its temptation; a Mentor will tell you that this is exactly the sort of lie the Sovereigns use to trick you into following their rules.</p>\n<p>The Shadow is also the keeper of forbidden knowledge, of secrets you know you shouldn’t pursue. This includes arcane magic—granting powers virtuous people should shun. Any spellcasting character could attribute their powers to the Shadow; a wizard might have been struggling with their studies, but after a sacrifice to the Shadow, they awoke with new insights. The Shadow can also serve as a warlock’s patron, likely in the role of the Fiend or the Hexblade. While the Shadow won’t interact directly with a warlock, they could receive visions like a priest; they could interact with a fiend who claims to speak for the Shadow; or they could be mistaken about the nature of their patron, and actually be bound to the overlord Sul Khatesh.</p>\n<p>In addition to mystical knowledge, priests of the Shadow often know things they simply shouldn’t know—secrets that can harm people if revealed. Priests of the Shadow can sometimes be found working as fixers in the criminal underworld; how much are you willing to pay for the knowledge you seek?</p>\n<p>Beyond all this, the Shadow is seen as a corrupting force that creates monsters, both figuratively through temptation, and literally—it is said to have created many of the monstrosities that prey on innocents. In turn, many monstrous creatures see the Shadow as their patron.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Ambition, temptation, forbidden knowledge, monsters</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Obsidian tower</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Quarterstaff</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> The Shadow’s priests must have some knowledge of both magic and the natural world, and many are equally proficient with both arcane and divine magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Quests:</strong> Followers quest to unearth ancient and forbidden lore, lead good people into temptation, or twist things of the natural world to suit selfish ends.</li>\n<li><strong>Prayers and Rites:</strong> The Shadow is invoked in the name of ambition or discovery, especially arcane insight.

They manifested the Mark of Passage nineteen hundred years ago, enhancing their skills with supernatural abilities that swiftly allowed them to dominate the roads of central Khorvaire. The dragonmarks were a celebrated phenomenon by this point, and the extended Orien family established itself as a dragonmarked house in short order.</p>\n<p>In the days before Galifar, few except the couriers and caravans of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} could cross the boundaries of nations and the holds of minor warlords in safety. With the help of the Mark of Passage and a knack for diplomacy, it became possible for Orien messengers to send information and packages from one end of Khorvaire to the other, with an excellent probability that the goods would arrive intact and in time. Orien caravans also carried human cargo, and as workers and explorers moved across the continent, the house became one of the primary forces driving the commonality of culture that marks Khorvaire today.</p>\n<p>Even as Orien's mundane transportation services connected the Khorvaire of the common folk, the Mark of Passage provided the house with services so exclusive—and so expensive—that few but kings and queens could afford them. In a united Galifar, nobles who might once have fought each other were forced to curry diplomatic favor and entertain their peers at court. However, the vastness of Khorvaire (not to mention the land's many dangers) made mundane travel for a royal retinue impractical at best. As such, the teleport ability of the greater Mark of Passage quickly became Orien's most requested (and most profitable) service. Effortless and instantaneous travel between the courts of Galifar helped establish the foundation of communication and trust among the nobility that allowed the new kingdom to thrive.</p>\n<p>As its routes stabilized and Galifar grew, Orien took on a royal commission that seemed like little more than a dream at the time: to connect Galifar's cities with highspeed transport that would allow travel across the kingdom in a matter of days. In 811 YK, the first lightning rail line was established between Fairhaven and Flamekeep. In 845 YK, King Jarot announced his intention to see the lightning rail connect every corner of Galifar, a task that Orien completed in less than twenty years.</p>\n<p>With lines of conductor stones spanning the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, Orien controlled three crown-subsidized lightning rail routes, all running through the heart of the nation in Cyre. From its humble origins on the trails and trade roads of Aundair, Orien had grown to the house that held a kingdom together.</p>\n<h2>Dark Path Ahead</h2>\n<p>What Orien had built over a lifetime, the Last War shattered in two terrible events. The first of these was in 899 YK, when the White Arch Bridge across Scions Sound was destroyed, most likely by order of King Kaius I. The bridge, which connected the city of Rekkenmark in Karrnath with Thaliost in Thrane, was an indefensible liability for both nations, but when it fell, Orien's primary east–west link across Khorvaire fell with it. In the aftermath of the war, many have spoken of the need to rebuild the bridge. However, Orien cannot afford the expense of reconstruction, and Thrane and Karrnath have little reason to want their kingdoms linked across the sound once more.</p>\n<p>The second and more devastating loss happened on the Day of Mourning. Orien's three routes met at Metrol, the crossroads of Khorvaire, which was destroyed in the cataclysm that razed Cyre. Orien still maintains that the Cyre lines are intact, but the house has yet to send a commercial coach into the Mournland. Reports from explorers in that wasted land hint that many conductor stones have been stolen, leaving gaps large enough to derail a coach.</p>\n<p>Since the war's end, Orien has managed to go some distance toward offsetting the loss of its profitable lightning rail runs with its other courier and transport services. At the same time, the viceroys of the house are determined to reclaim their former wealth and status, but they know that doing so will require allies. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} might never again be one, but the house hopes that the leaders of those nations can be convinced of the need to reforge links to each other's lands.</p>\n<h2>House Orien Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Organizations in House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]{House Orien as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{People of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien in the World]{House Orien in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Orien]{Playing a Member of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.By Road and Rail]{By Road and Rail}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_wcf9z2v1mgb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"CuqScwpaB4iy3xBw","name":"Denizens of Lamannia","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Denizens of Lamannia</h1>\n<p>A common story about Lamannia tells of an explorer who passed through a manifest zone and found herself on a vast mountain peak. Pressing up the mountain, she was exploring a mysterious thicket when she was set upon by rats the size of wolves. She fought the rats, but was on the verge of being overwhelmed . . . until a giant beak flashed down and snapped up a rat in a single bite. The wide “thicket” wasn’t natural briar; it was the nest of a gargantuan roc, one of Lamannia’s many impressive denizens.</p>\n<h2>Beasts</h2>\n<p>Lamannia’s primary inhabitants are beasts—both ones that you might encounter in the wilds of Eberron, and massive creatures that can be seen as iconic representations of their type: the idealized incarnation of Bear or Wolf. Any natural creature can be found in Lamannia; indeed, some sages assert that the presence of a creature in Lamannia is what defines it as “natural.”</p>\n<p>For the most part, Lamannian beasts are no smarter than their counterparts on Eberron. However, some animals possess intelligence similar to that granted by the awaken spell, though even these beasts generally follow their natural instincts and live wild lives. While the giant owls of Sharn may own shops and run for city council, the giant owls of Lamannia are content to hunt the beasts of the Twilight Forest. So it’s possible to find creatures in Lamannia that speak Common or a Primordial dialect, but most have little interest in long conversations.</p>\n<p>The beasts of Lamannia generally fall into the following four categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Mundane animals</strong> are identical to their counterparts in Eberron. Any natural creature can be found in a layer with an appropriate environment. If such beasts are the first things adventurers encounter in a visit to Lamannia, they might not even realize they’ve traveled to another plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Dire animals </strong>are creatures of remarkable size. Such creatures are more common than mundane animals; in the Twilight Forest, most owls are giant owls, and they prey on giant weasels and rats. The Monster Manual has a few examples of “dire” and “giant” beasts, but any natural beast could have a dire counterpart in Lamannia.</p>\n<p><strong>Megafauna </strong>are gargantuan beasts. The roc is an example of Lamannian megafauna; those found in Eberron have been drawn through manifest zones or slipped between planes during coterminous periods. The DM can create a wide range of megafauna; a pack of gargantuan wolves could hound the adventurers, or they might meet a megafauna serpent that uses the statistics of a purple worm—perhaps even a megafauna dinosaur! While these creatures are similar in form to beasts, they are typically classified as monstrosities. Between their vast size and their connection to the plane, they’re immune to most effects that target beasts, and you can’t charm a roc with a simple animal friendship spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Totems </strong>are beasts that are beyond the tactical scale— creatures that can be measured in miles. The gnome explorer Tasker tells a tale of an island in the Endless Ocean that turned out to be an enormous turtle; another of his stories features a pack of lycanthropes living in the fur of a massive roaming wolf. Such totems aren’t natural creatures and don’t need to eat. Their origins and purpose are unsolved mysteries, but most sages believe that they are immortal spirits projected by the plane itself. Some claim that the totems are connected to all creatures cast in their image. Others believe that the totems are sources of primal power, and barbarians, shifters, and druids can receive power and guidance from them. All that’s known for sure is that they’re immune to common spells, and there are no accounts of anyone successfully harming or communicating with a totem.</p>\n<h2>ElEmEntals</h2>\n<p>After beasts, the most common inhabitants of the plane are elementals. Unlike the genies, mephits, and anthropomorphic elementals of Fernia and Syrania, Lamannia’s elementals are the pure, living essence of the elements, unburdened by any humanoid desire. These include the standard earth, fire, air, and water elementals, but they can come in a wide array of sizes and forms. Adventurers exploring the Broken Lands could encounter tiny globs of lava crawling across the land, while the leviathans of the Endless Ocean and the elder tempests of the First Storm are forces of apocalyptic power.</p>\n<p>The Zil gnomes commonly summon and bind the elementals of Lamannia, using them to propel lightning rails and airships. While intelligent, these elementals are utterly alien. They have little concept of time and perceive the world purely through the balance of elements. The sole desire of most elementals is to express their element: to burn, to flow, to fly. Many have an antagonistic attitude toward spirits of other elements, which drives the deadly conflict between them in the Broken Land—this poses an obstacle in dealing with elementals, as they tend to perceive humanoids as globs of water. While it’s possible for a character that speaks Primordial to talk with a Lamannian elemental, it’s usually difficult to establish any sort of common basis for negotiation. Still, there are legends of wandering druids who “befriended earth and air,” so anything is possible!</p>\n<h2>Humanoids</h2>\n<p>There are merfolk in Eberron—such as the Kalamer of the Thunder Sea—but their people began in the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, and are still found there. These primordial merfolk remain close to their elemental roots and instincts. They wield druidic magic, but don’t craft tools or structures. Other humanoid natives of Lamannia are much the same; any race with a strong primal connection could be tied to Lamannia, but they’re driven by instinct and avoid the trappings of civilization. There could be tabaxi dwelling in the branches of the Twilight Forest, but if so, they’ll seem wild.</p>\n<p>Over a century ago, during the Silver Crusade, there were many lycanthropes who fled to Lamannia. As long as they remain on this plane, a lycanthrope can’t spread the curse to anyone other than their offspring, and the unnatural impulses of the curse—the drive to prey on innocents, the bloodlust that can cause a victim of lycanthropy to lose control of their actions—are suspended. Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren’t driven to evil, and remain in full control. Packs and communities of lycanthropes are scattered across the layers. Most are descended from lycanthropes who fled Eberron to escape both the templars and the dark power whose corrupting influence led to the crusade; these shapeshifters embrace their primal nature and rarely assume humanoid forms. But there are also packs descended from afflicted templars who chose exile over death, and who strive to preserve the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.</p>\n<p>A handful of druids and rangers have crossed into Lamannia and chosen to remain in this primal paradise. Many run with lycanthrope packs, embracing their feral instincts and spending their days in wild shape. Others act as planar shepherds, seeking to minimize the impact of dangerous manifest zones and help unwary travelers.</p>\n<h2>Greater Powers?</h2>\n<p>There are no celestials or fiends in Lamannia. Yet explorers often report a feeling that they are being watched, and there are times when random events seem to be guided by an unseen hand. When outsiders have sought to establish industries in Lamannia, they’ve been attacked by megafauna or elder elementals, or struck by especially vicious turns of weather. It’s possible that this is the work of the totems, and that they have great influence over their layers. Or there could be a greater power that watches over the entire plane. Some scholars assert that the moon Olarune is the consciousness that governs the plane, and Eldeen shifter traditions that predate the practices of the Wardens of the Wood also reflect this belief. Shifter druids suggest that Olarune created the shifters, and the first lycanthropes were her champions.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/lamannia-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6q5tcslkt0e","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

The mythical Mroranon is said to have been the son of the last king of the Realm Below, and to have rallied the exiles to establish the Mror Holds. Talespinners say that it was Kol Korran’s bargain with Mroranon that ensured prosperity for the dwarves, and Krona Peak is home to both the Iron Council and Kol Korran’s Throne, the largest temple dedicated to the Sovereign in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>While Mroranonhold has a wide variety of mines, it’s best known for iron and mithral.

What sets the Mroranon apart is leadership. Mroranon sees the future and inspires others to follow. Mroranon unites, and makes wise decisions for the good of all. This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leader— Doldarun is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the Sovereign Host and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout Mror priests and powerful adepts hail from Mroranonhold.</p>\n<p>With the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon has the deepest investment in the Realm Below. It has multiple colony outposts, including one tied to a demiplane mine and another holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line while building power for another surge. Mroranon and its vassal clans have recovered many legendary relics and artifacts from the depths. While they don’t oppose symbionts as strongly as Doldarun, they refuse to make use of dularash items and assert that any contact with the daelkyr or their creations is dangerous.</p>\n<p>Acolyte, noble, and soldier are common backgrounds for Mroranon dwarves. While paladins are more likely to be found in Doldarun, clerics (especially Knowledge, Trickery, or Life), fighters, and bards are all sound choices for Mroranon.

However, the aftermath of the Day of Mourning has left the house divided in resources as well as loyalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics: </strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} covets magic items, especially those of Cyre and Xen'drik. Members who find such items are strongly encouraged to bring them to the house, which then researches them or loans them to those on house assignments. Items are evaluated, and the member who found them is paid 65% of the estimated worth. In addition, Cannith South will subsidize up to one-half the total cost of house expeditions to Xen'drik or Cyre, as long as such expeditions leave from Sharn and include at least one Cannith South member.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear:</strong> Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} are always well outfitted—anything less would be an affront to the house's pride. Those on Cannith business are fully outfitted with mundane equipment, and those on personal business pay only 25% of the standard cost for mundane gear. Information: Members can have magic items identified for 50% of the normal cost and get access to maps and reports from Cannith explorers in Cyre and Xen'drik.</p>\n<p><strong>Access: </strong>Only members of the house and their associates have access to the house's forges and workshops.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Such informal favoritism is not a substitute for the Favored in House feat, and both DM and player should remember that family ties work both ways.

The Thuranni coat of arms also includes the image of a length of chain attached to a spiked bar. Heirs claim it symbolizes both their power and the chains that once bound them to tradition and to the Phiarlan. Those few who dare to imply that the image's similarity to a flail—the traditional weapon of the Order of the Emerald Claw—is anything more than coincidence are likely to face mocking derision in public, and in private, much, much worse.</p>\n<p>Where the elves of Phiarlan employ the mask of shadows as a secondary standard, Thuranni has adopted the symbol of a crescent moon, its face wreathed in shadow. Members of the house wear this symbol in the form of a small pendant, often hidden beneath the tunic or shirt.</p>\n<p>Unlike the house from which it split, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] makes no pretense to neutrality. The house sees its actions as having greater purpose than simply supporting the subtle machinations of lords and kings. This ideological separation combines with the house's business philosophy to make heirs of Thuranni more ruthless and aggressive than the Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Most residents of Khorvaire have a passing knowledge that the elves of the Mark of Shadow now comprise two distinct families, but few have any real knowledge of the Shadow Schism or the philosophical divisions that drove the split. Those familiar with the art world know that the heirs of Thuranni comprise the talented painters, sculptors, and architects that once blessed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but Thuranni heirs typically receive the same degree of respect and awe as Phiarlan heirs (and are often mistaken for them).</p>\n<p>Those who know of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} are more reserved in their dealings with members of the house, though this apprehension can either improve or worsen starting attitudes, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]'s strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is House Tharashk. The House of Finding is also young and ambitious, and was quick to side with Thuranni after the Schism. Heirs of Phiarlan react to Thuranni with cold detachment, and prefer to keep any encounters brief. At the same time, both houses share a wariness of the Bloody Shadows (see page 119), who are more hostile to heirs of Thuranni than any other group.</p>\n<h2>House Thuranni's Holdings</h2>\n<p>The power of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] is centered in and around the Lhazaar Principalities. The Shadow Network likes to discourage the idea that its operations are based in any one location, but the powerful families that make up the house claim territories that are more or less their own. The Thuranni family, led by the house patriarch, Elar d'Thuranni (LN male elf rogue 6/dragonmark heir 3), has holdings in the Lhazaar capital of Regalport and in Sharn, and most high-level house business is carried out in these two places. The patriarch has also been developing a massive, heavily fortified family enclave near the northern island of Stonespur for the last two decades.</p>\n<p>The town of Tantamar, on the northern coast of the Lhazaar Principalities, is the center of house activity on the mainland. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] has additional enclaves in Droaam, Karrnath, and Q'barra, and has established outposts and safe houses across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Thuranni IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Few Thuranni heirs travel to perform or present their arts, so their casual introduction often requires a context. Characters who attend a gala or other event might see Thuranni sculpture on display, or could be introduced to the Thuranni prodigy who designed the hall itself. One of the ironies of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] is that Phiarlan operatives often find themselves performing within concert halls and theaters designed by Thuranni artisans.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Organizations in House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]{House Thuranni as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Thuranni]{People of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni in the World]{House Thuranni in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Thuranni]{Playing a Member of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_7hlrvwctt1n","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Forty millennia after their flight from Xen'drik, the families of the house still seek purpose, and the secrets they uncover are fragments of a puzzle of fate that has yet to be assembled. This drive is epitomized by the Dragon's Path, an organization dedicated to discovering the secrets of the draconic Prophecy.</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE THURANNI</h2>\n<p>By virtue of its young age and dark business, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} is a remarkably guarded organization. Where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} found it necessary to open up while rebuilding after the Shadow Schism, the heirs of Thuranni have sealed their operations tightly. The house intends to concentrate on solidifying its power base for the time being, rather than embracing new and potentially troublesome members. At the same time, the house is obliged to accept foundlings and other legitimate heirs (if only to prevent Phiarlan from snapping them up), but such members are always watched closely.</p>\n<p>Experts are common in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, as are rogues, scouts, and bards.

He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. The Devourer is the glorious cruelty that drives the predator, the cry of the hawk and the howl of the wolf. He is all that is wild, savage, and unknowable. He is the deepest ocean, a force that can be crossed but never controlled.</p>\n<p>Those who fear the Devourer see him as an entirely destructive force. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Arawai} is the patron of agriculture, of peacefully harvesting nature’s bounty. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Balinor]{Balinor} is the patron of the hunt, of civilized folk using bow, spear, and skill to challenge or tame the mightiest beasts. These deities reflect the power of civilization to harness and control the natural world, but the Devourer puts the lie to this, showing that nature will never be truly tamed.</p>\n<p>Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don’t hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts, or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. They may serve as intermediaries, convincing the Devourer to redirect his wrath and spare their followers—or to turn his rage against their enemies.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature's wrath, hunger, nautical travel, storms, water.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> A bundle of five sharpened bones or a dragon turtle</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Trident</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> Priests of the Devourer are familiar with nature in general, and with water and storms in particular.

Thirteen hundred years ago, the lords of the nations now known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} began a campaign of extermination against the changeling race. Many changelings fled to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, hiding among humanity. But one among them was not satisfied with survival. This changeling was named Kel, and he had a vision of a changeling homeland: a realm on the edge of the world, where changelings could live away from the fearful scrutiny of humanity. He traveled the land, speaking to family after family, and slowly an exodus began—a journey that ended on the island of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lastpoint]{Lastpoint}. There, staring into the disturbing wall of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide]{Gray Tide}, Kel declared that they had found their home.</p>\n<p>No outsider knows the full size of the Gray Tide principality. Some estimates say that there are over fifty thousand changelings in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities}, though it is impossible to know for certain. Changelings have spread out across the islands, and many of the brothels and theaters in the Principalities are run by changelings. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lastpoint]{Lastpoint} changelings also serve as guides, interpreters, and mediators, serving as hirelings on ships of other princes. Some Lhazaarites fear that the changelings have spread far deeper into Lhazaar society than anyone knows. But most are willing to see the changelings as brothers on the sea, and they are more accepted in this region than anywhere else in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Gray Tide principality is thought to have four ships, and common belief holds that it does participate in piracy. However, a host of rumors has circulated about the principality. Some say that the changelings can enter the Gray Tide without danger, and that they have a fleet hidden within it. Other tales claim that the changelings have developed ships that can shift appearance, so that their acts of piracy are blamed on others. The truth of these tales is in the hands of the DM. </p>\n<h3>PRINCE KEL</h3>\n<p>The Gray Tide principality is ruled by Prince Kel, and it has been since its founding. Most outsiders believe that this is the work of one or more changelings—a lineage that preserves Kel's image. Some say that Last Point is the seat of the secret society known as the Cabinet of Faces; if so, this is one more secret hidden on this island.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Power Groups of the Lhazaar Principalities</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Bloodsail Principality]{Bloodsail Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Cloudreaver Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Coldtide Principality]{Coldtide Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide Principality]{Gray Tide Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Heavenly Fleet]{Heavenly Fleet}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principality of the Diresharks]{Principality of the Diresharks}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Seadragon Principality]{Seadragon Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wind Whisperer Principality]{Wind Whisperer Principality}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_0m345fwgs5kb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The city was abandoned after the daelkyr released a horde of basilisks, gorgons, and cockatrices from the depths of Khyber. The streets of the ruined city are still filled with petrified goblins and hobgoblins, although most of these statues have been shattered or eroded by the ravages of time. The monsters that ravaged the city in ancient times still dominate the region, and other strange anomalies are found here, such as petrification-resistant gargoyles and places where trees and other vegetation have become petrified.</p>\n<p>The passage to Khyber near the center of the ruined city remains open, even after nine thousand years. Two hundred twenty years ago (778 YK), a band of medusas came up from Khyber and took possession of Cazhaak Draal, renovating a few of the buildings for their own use. The medusas have domesticated many of the other creatures in the region and have slowly expanded their power base. The city's physical size is far larger than that of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{Great Crag}, but the medusas inhabit only a small part of it, and their individual lairs are often some distance apart. Over the years, they have been exploring the ruins and searching for treasures left behind by the goblinoids. However, other beasts have come from Khyber as well, and there are things hidden in Cazhaak Draal that even the medusas fear. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Queen Sheshka} currently leads the medusa community, styling herself as the Queen of Stone.</p>\n<p>The lore of the Kech Volaar suggests that great treasures are hidden within Cazhaak Draal, some of which the medusas have likely found.

{"_id":"EcVMJHuODjZIndrA","name":"Chaos Fleet","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Chaos Fleet</h1>\n<p>Thirty years ago, a pirate named Magwroth thought to seize control of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Cloudreaver Principality}, challenging the rule of Sea Prince @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Mika Rockface}. The results were one-sided. Magwroth was hideously injured, his vessel <em>Devourer’s Hand</em> was severely damaged, and the rest of his ragtag fleet was sunk. After limping away under tattered sails, Magwroth was never seen again, and it was assumed that Devourer’s Hand had vanished beneath the waves. Would that it had.</p>\n<p>Carried on furious currents through the blinding mist of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide]{Gray Tide}, <em>Devourer’s Hand</em> passed into the heart of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Kythri]{Kythri}, the wildest region of the Elemental Chaos. There, Magwroth and the remains of his crew were consumed by a host of inhuman creatures that now sail a ghostly fleet across the Lhazaar Sea.</p>\n<p>The Chaos Fleet consists of half a dozen to two dozen vessels, its numbers changing from day to day. Several of the ships, including <em>Devourer’s Hand</em>, are mortal-built wrecks kept afloat by the elemental power that now infuses their waterlogged hulls. The other ships hail from the Elemental Chaos and are driven by the power of fire and air. Though they appear to be roughly carved of rock or ice, these chaos ships are impossibly swift and can run down even elemental galleons.</p>\n<h3>Chaos Fleet Lore</h3>\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge:</strong> Thirty years ago, a pirate captain named Magwroth tried to usurp the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Cloudreaver Principality} from Sea Prince @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Mika Rockface}. Magwroth was soundly defeated, last seen at the helm of his damaged ship, <em>Devourer’s Hand</em>, as it limped out to sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge:</strong> In recent months, a number of vessels have vanished from what were thought to be safe sea lanes near the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities}. No known pirates have claimed responsibility, and no wreckage has been found.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge with a raise:</strong> Pirates and merchants have reported seeing a bizarre fleet of ships on the horizon of the Lhazaar Sea. The lead vessel appeared to be a Lhazaar warship, but the ships that flanked it were oddly misshapen. Mysterious colored lightning was said to dance between the masts of this ghostly fleet.</p>\n<h3>Magwroth, Chaos Fleet Captain</h3>\n<p>Though it wears the face and form of Captain Magwroth, the commander of this fleet is an elemental being of pure destructive energy. It now occupies Magwroth’s flesh, with the mind and soul of the captain imprisoned inside an elemental drudge (see below).</p>\n<p>The crew of <em>Devourer’s Hand</em> and the other mortalbuilt ships of the fleet likewise consist of creatures that have been possessed by elemental forces. A ritual transforms a living humanoid into a Chaos Fleet sailor, then creates an elemental drudge empowered by the mortal’s soul. The ice and stone vessels are crewed by archons, demons, and other elemental creatures.</p>\n<p>For the moment, “Magwroth” seems content to attack and raid lone vessels. However, the ships and crews he destroys are taken under his control, and so the Chaos Fleet has begun to grow. In time, Magwroth could threaten not just the Lhazaar Principalities but all of coastal Khorvaire. Only then might his ultimate objective become clear: to destroy all life.</p>\n<p>From a distance, the captain resembles the half-elf Magwroth, but on closer inspection, the facade falls. The elemental’s gaping wounds reveal burning fire racing like blood beneath its skin. Ugly bulges mar its flesh, tearing open as it moves to reveal icy protrusions beneath. Lightning dances within its pupils, and a dark smoke hisses from its blackened teeth and lips.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_0m345fwgs5kb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Smoky Towers is the entertainment district of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Menthis]{Middle Menthis}, known for dinner theaters, recital halls, and one grand theater. It presents a grade of entertainment that falls between the burlesque of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Torchfire]{Torchfire} and the classical drama of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.University District]{University District}—affordable yet respectable, accessible yet thoughtful. </p>\n<p>A small but significant number of people who trace their origin to Cyre have made their home in Smoky Towers. Although culturally they differ little from their Brelish neighbors, this community has become very active in the wake of Cyre's destruction, discussing rebuilding or reestablishing the nation elsewhere in Khorvaire. The Citadel keeps the Cyran community here under close watch due to this potentially treasonous talk.​</p>\n<h2>Smoky Towers at a Glance</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Quarter:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Menthis Plateau]{Menthis Plateau}</li>\n<li><strong>Ward:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Menthis]{Middle Menthis}</li>\n<li><strong>District Type: </strong>Theater district</li>\n<li><strong>Buildings: </strong>​Theaters (4), temple (Olladra), average lodging (10), poor lodging (30), average food (20), poor food (55), average trades (30), poor trades (60), average services (40), poor services (80), average residences (20), poor residences (40)</li>\n<li><strong>First Impression: </strong>​Theaters, restaurants, and concert halls offer the promise of an evening's musical entertainment in this district.​</li>\n<li><strong>Social Class:</strong> Lower middle class</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Smoky Towers Highlights</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"black-row\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"2\">Locations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Classic Theater</td>\n<td>A small and inexpensive theater, the Classic performs only works written before the start of the Last War.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mizano Rupa's</td>\n<td>Mizano Rupa's is one of three important dinner theater venues in Smoky Towers that give rising stars a stop on their ascent between Gailan's and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Menthis]{Upper Menthis} Plateau.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Starfire Dragon</td>\n<td>​The Starfire Dragon offers a steady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals.

For performers on the move in Menthis's entertainment scene, the Atrium is a definite step up from most of the dinner theaters in the district, and many of its performers are only a few years away from being ready for the Kavarrah Concert Hall.​</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thovanic Hall</td>\n<td>​Similar to the Atrium, Thovanic Hall is a former theater converted to use as a recital hall. It is still very new (the renovation was completed only two years ago), and is still trying to build its reputation as a place for fine music to compete with the Atrium. As a distinguishing point, Thovanic presents a significant number of non-Brelish and even nonhuman performers, who bring diversity to the musical offerings that the residents of Middle Menthis find sorely lacking in the district's other offerings.​</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"black-row\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"2\">Key Personalities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mizano Rupa</td>\n<td>Mizano is hardly a connoisseur of fine music, but he knows what he likes and—fortunately—his tastes seem to compare with those of many in Middle Menthis, making his establishment quite popular.​</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amman Todav</td>\n<td>Trying to compete in a crowded market, the Starfire Dragon's owner, Amman Todav, has hired excellent cooks, and the restaurant's menu offerings reflect the trouble he has gone to.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Classic Theater</h3>\n<p>​The only major theater in Middle Menthis, the Classic lives up to its name by performing only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. While the Grand Stage in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.University District]{University District} also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works.

Reservations are recommended.​</p>\n<h3>Starfire Dragon</h3>\n<p>​The Starfire Dragon offers a steady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals. In this case, however, the entertainment clearly takes a back seat to the food. Amman Todav, the owner, lost a good portion of his hearing fighting in the Last War, and judges performers more on their looks than the quality of their performances.

{"_id":"EsMvbLCDfnNH330Y","name":"Lesser Arcane Orders","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Lesser Arcane Orders</h1>\n</div>\n<p>The circles mentioned above have considerable prestige and significant resources. They have broad areas of study; while Moonlight may specialize in Illusion and Enchantment, you can still discuss evocation in the hall. But especially in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, there are a host of lesser orders. Most have a narrow focus and more limited resources. Members of the Lodge of the Eternal Flame are acknowledged as some of the most accomplished pyromancers in Khorvaire, but they only accept Evokers and refuse to practice any form of frost-related magic, and they only have a single hall. Here's a few of these lesser orders.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dolurrh's Gate:</strong> Based in Fairhaven in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, this is one of the only respected orders of Necromancers in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Members of the order focus on the positive uses of necromancy, such as the practical value of speak with dead; they're also experts on undead, studying how to contain and control undead threats.</li>\n<li><strong>The Golden Seal:</strong> This order of Abjurers is based in Fairhaven in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Originally part of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arcane Order of Aureon]{Arcane Order of Aureon}, they were split from the main order in 312 YK and charged with maintaining the mystic defenses of the Arcane Congress—and in replicating the abilities of the Mark of Warding. It was wizards of the Golden Seal who first perfected the common glyph of warding spells used in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. While small, this is an elite order whose members gained considerable prestige during the Last War.</li>\n<li><strong>The Guild of Endless Doors:</strong> Based in the city of Passage in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, this guild of Conjurers catalogs manifest zones that can serve as planar portals, along with the circumstances that can open them. They are determined to unlock the secrets of teleportation, and to make this a part of everyday life. They have often feuded with the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers, and some believe that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} has sabotaged their research. It's worth noting that the Guild of Endless Doors did develop the forms of teleport, teleportation circle, and misty step currently taught at Arcanix; it's simply that those first two spells are largely useless because of how few people in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} can actually cast them, and they are working on developing more accessible forms of this magic. However, they are a lesser order and lack the resources of Orien.</li>\n<li><strong>The Keepers of Aureon's Veil:</strong> The Keepers are a semi-monastic order, who maintain the Starpeaks Observatory in the mountains close to the village of Askelios. While reclusive, they are respected for their exceptional work with divination; when a Keeper addresses the arcane congress, people listen. This is an excellent option for a Diviner with the hermit background.</li>\n<li><strong>The Lodge of the Eternal Flame:</strong> Located in the city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thaliost]{Thaliost}, this order of Evokers specializes in pyromancy. The Lodge is located on a small manifest zone tied to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Fernia]{Fernia}, and the “Eternal Flame” is a manifestation of that.</li>\n<li><strong>The Children of Siberys:</strong> One of the newest circles is based in Arcanix, and is notable in that it doesn't actually involve wizards. This article discusses “Dragonblood sorcerers”—sorcerers who use the trappings and techniques of arcane magic to focus their gifts. Traditionally these sorcerers have been rare curiosities. Recently Arcanix Provost Iria ir'Rayne posited that there may be considerably more latent Dragonblood sorcerers in the world than we realize, simply waiting for their powers to be recognized and released. Iria founded the Children of Siberys in 989 YK, with the intention of both guiding Dragonblood students and in studying the nature of Dragonblood sorcery. At the moment it's a small order that lacks resources or influence, but ir'Rayne is fighting to expand the circle. A player character who chooses to be a Dragonblood sorcerer could easily be an important member of the Children, even at low level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, these are just a few of the lesser orders… and these are orders that are active today, not taking into account the many circles that have fallen over time, on their own or through hostile action (like the Closed Circle of Sharn).</p>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_p7ucda8npuk","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/08.

However, by virtue of its influence on agriculture, the smaller Raincallers Guild arguably has a larger impact on life in Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>THE RAINCALLERS GUILD</h2>\n<p>A character with the Mark of Storm can summon rain to save farmers from drought or keep a hurricane from devastating a coastal city. The Raincallers Guild has devoted centuries to the development of irrigation systems, dams, canals, levees, and reservoirs to help control the forces of nature. The unmarked members of the guild focus on these services.</p>\n<p>In addition, Raincallers often serve as traveling emissaries of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}, and are trained in the arts of diplomacy. Large cities often have Raincaller outposts, but the guild also maintains a corps of wanderers who travel regular circuits throughout the agricultural regions of the Five Nations.</p>\n<h2>THE WINDWRIGHTS GUILD</h2>\n<p>The Windwrights Guild dominates the shipping trade. The core fleet of the guild is made up of the elementalbound vessels and airships of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}, crewed by heirs of the house and providing speedy transport by water or air. Most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar's} members work with the Windwrights Guild, which provides crews, dockside support, stevedoring, and repairs for seafaring and airborne ships. However, the vast majority of the guild is composed of independent captains who need not be heirs of the house, or even half-elves. To earn the flag of the Windwrights Guild, a captain must pass regular inspections and pay house dues. In exchange, the guild connects him with customs and cargo.</p>\n<p>Most independent ship captains consider the Lyrandar flag to be a deterrent to pirates. However, common belief holds that captains who choose to work outside the guild are likely to suffer “accidents” ranging from deadly weather to sabotage or piracy. Regardless of whether Lyrandar truly engages in such sinister practices, the rumor alone is enough to convince prospective clients to rely on guild shipping, forcing most captains to work within the guild. The sailors of the Lhazaar Principalities are a notable exception to this rule, and there has long been tension between the Windwrights and the eastern sea lords.</p>\n<h2>Sela's Path</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} maintains its own priesthood, venerating @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arawai]{Arawai}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Kol Korran]{Kol Korran}, and the house's founders Lyran and Selavash. Those who follow Sela's Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran sent Lyran and Selavash their dragon marks to bring unity and prosperity to the half-elf people. Its adherents maintain that the souls of the firstborn serve as intermediaries between the Khoravar and the Sovereign Host, just as Tira Miron is said to speak for the Silver Flame.</p>\n<h2>Lyran's Gift</h2>\n<p>The arcane researchers of Lyran's Gift work with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{the Twelve} to make better, faster elemental airships and galleons. At secret laboratories in Stormhome and on islands in the Bitter Sea, they also test magic catapults and other defensive naval devices.</p>\n<h2>Storm Front</h2>\n<p>The Storm Front is rumored to be a cult operating within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arawai]{Arawai} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Kol Korran]{Kol Korran} but the mark of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Devourer]{the Devourer}. Cult members maintain that the greatest members of the house live on as krakens in the deep, and that these immortal elders guide the Storm Front through visions. The Storm Front believes that the power of the Mark of Storm was meant to be used for destruction, and that the Khoravar should seize dominion through force, not wait for their time to come. Darker tales suggest that Esravash is just a figure head or a dupe, and that the Storm Front is the true power guiding @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. According to these rumors, the cult maintains hidden enclaves throughout coastal Khorvaire, including Tlalusk Island off the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Demon Wastes]{Demon Wastes}.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Organizations in House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{People of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]{House Lyrandar as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar in the World]{House Lyrandar in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]{Playing a Member of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]{Legacy of the Firstborn}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8akcoe6m16h","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

In accordance with tradition, no heir of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} has ever married into @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, but on a few rare occasions, halflings with aberrant dragonmarks have married Ghallanda heirs—a practice that would be all but impossible in any other dragonmarked house. The vast majority of the members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} have NPC class levels; those who have levels in PC classes are often rogues, bards, wizards, scouts, or swashbucklers. The swashbuckler class is common in Khorvaire, especially in the cities of the former @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Scouts were found among all the armies of the Last War.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]{Halfling}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} by blood or marriage.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} commonly work at one of the house's bound businesses. Experts, commoners, and magewrights perform the everyday tasks of the house, while rogues often serve as bouncers and security consultants, dealing with threats as quickly and quietly as possible. Bards and rogues also work to help the house establish and maintain its web of connections, making contacts among the nobility as easily as among the criminal underworld.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE GHALLANDA BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>Ghallanda's power is not measured on the same scale as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House]{Cannith's} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak's}, but house membership provides a number of benefits of use to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> A Ghallanda heir in good standing is welcome at any house business, normally receiving a 50% discount on lodging, food, and other goods and services. An heir in a desperate state can receive free food and lodging, though he and any companions are expected to earn their keep through labor.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> The greatest benefit of Ghallanda membership might well be the network of communication that thrives throughout the house. The heirs of Ghallanda enjoy the company of family and friends, and they love discussing gossip and local news. House members can gain invaluable inside information on nobles, criminals, merchants, and common folk.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Ghallanda]{Organizations in House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{People of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda as an Organization]{House Ghallanda as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda in the World]{House Ghallanda in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Ghallanda]{Playing a Member of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sign of the Helpful Hound]{Sign of the Helpful Hound}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-ghallanda-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ynwg8edl1rl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Long before the house was formed, the early phiarlans divided the arts into five disciplines, with the greatest masters and teachers of each settling in the five major enclaves of the house, known as demesnes.</p>\n<p>The five disciplines and their demesnes are described below:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Demesne of Memory: </strong>This discipline encompasses the written word, including prose, poetry, and even propaganda. History might be dictated by the victors, but the smartest hire Phiarlan word-weavers to write it down. Novelists, playwrights, and poets are all students of memory. This Demesne contains one of the finest libraries in Khorvaire, a repository both of general knowledge and songs and stories. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven and run by Viceroy Dulaen Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Motion:</strong> These are the arts of the body, including dance, gymnastics, wrestling, contortion, massage, and more. Gymnasts, dancers, and wrestlers are students of motion. For students of motion, combat is a celebration. Gifted students of motion are often recruited by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, their skills adapted to burglary and battle. The Demesne of Motion is located in Wroat, the capital of Breland. It is administered by Viceroy Surael Shol d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Music: </strong>The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, including song and the use of instruments. While most bards learn the basic traditions of music, the members of this Demesne delve deeper in their study of the fundamental principles of music. These teachings reflect a wealth of musical techniques from across Eberron. Instructors here are well versed in Adaran chant, Marcher throat-singing, Thelanian ballads, and battle-chants of Shavarath. The demesne is located in the city of Flamekeep, under the leadership of Viceroy Kels Tialaen d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Shape: </strong>The discipline of shape covers the creation of physical objects. Demesne of Shape teaches sculptors, painters, potters, and any form of physical art. Its students also create the resources the house requires for its entertainers, from fine instruments to sets and costumes. The smallest and least populated demesne, it holds a specialization few others have the expertise to teach. The masters of this discipline belonged to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{huranni} lines, and the newborn house claimed the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} enclave that housed the demesne during the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} city of Thaliost, but its operations are overshadowed by those of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. Currently the demesne is led by Viceroy Idal Tialaen d'Phiarlan.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Shadow: </strong>In its broadest sense, this is the art of deception. Deceptive magics are a powerful tool in the field of entertainment, and the Demesne of Shadow helps those who can wield these powers perfect their techniques. This includes the artistic use of illusions, puppetry, and literal shadow plays, but the Demesne of Shadow also encompasses the verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigning emotion, and playing a role. Actors and orators learn their craft at this demesne, and while a storyteller might create his tales at the Demesne of Memory, he learns to bring those tales fully to life at the Demesne of Shadow.\n<p>The first Demesne of Shadow was located in Metrol, but was relocated to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} after the Day of Mourning. The current matriarch of the house, Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, resides at the Demesne of Shadow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Phiarlan hydra has five heads, but a sixth is said to lurk in the shadow of the house crest. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} is the effective sixth demesne of Phiarlan, and the espionage arm of the house. The location of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} is a closely guarded secret, and its placement in the campaign is at the DM's discretion. It might be in a major city—perhaps even in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, hidden beneath the Demesne of Shadow. It could be concealed within a smaller community, or an entire town that exists only as a front for Phiarlan spies.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table, arranging jobs and ensuring that the local heirs of the house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. Active agents of the group are hidden even from this liaison, often scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Agents of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} hold one of four ranks. The least are known as shadows, and often serve simply as observers. Wraiths coordinate groups of shadows, while specters are elite troubleshooters. Ghosts are the legends of the house. Only a handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully guarded. The leader of the Serpentine Table is another mystery left to the purview of the DM. The interests of Phiarlan's spies are represented by the Seneschal Taen Shol d'Phiarlan, but those on the inside know that Taen is just a mouthpiece for the Serpentine Table's true master.</p>\n<p>The Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi lines have the most influence within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, but a number of lesser lines are well established in the house hierarchy. Prior to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thuranni} line had considerable power; today, just a few members of this bloodline remain in the house, and they are often treated with suspicion.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>To the average citizen of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} is as harmless as it is intriguing. When a house member is approached, he is likely to be asked which famous Phiarlan entertainers he knows. Those who know of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} treat members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} with more caution, whether out of respect (and a friendly reaction) or carefully veiled hostility.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, and members of that house are friendly toward scions and agents of Phiarlan. Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} typically treat their cousins with cool indifference, though some are more overtly hostile. The only true enemies of the house are the Bloody Shadows, who are always hostile toward Phiarlan heirs.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan's HEADQUARTERS</h2>\n<p>The five artistic demesnes, along with the hidden citadel of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, are the most important centers of house activity. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} has outposts across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}. Where it does not have an enclave, it often maintains a presence at the local @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gold Dragon Inn]{Gold Dragon Inn}, sharing costs and resources with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} also maintains hidden safe houses in cities across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Since the Shadow Schism, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} has been forced to leave @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} and the northeast in the hands of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. To make up for this loss of territory, it has been working to explore potential markets in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, with somewhat limited success.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Phiarlan IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Khorvaire's greatest entertainers are Phiarlan elves, or members of other races who have studied at one of the five demesnes. A singer in a random tavern is revealed to be an elf with the silver mask embroidered on his doublet. A noble lord arrives at a gala with a beautiful Phiarlan escort on his arm. The musicians entertaining at a dragonmarked house banquet bear the silhouette of the mask of shadows. A Phiarlan dancer might even be found in a grungy inn in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, astonishing the locals with her graceful movements and shadow play.</p>\n<p>The house's devotion to the arts can even serve as a source of adventure. A Phiarlan viceroy might ask an agent to retrieve a priceless tapestry from the ruins of Metrol, or send a young heir to Xen'drik in search of an epic poem lost since the fall of the giants.</p>\n<p>Characters engaged in intrigue will see the other side of the Phiarlan mask. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} never turns on its own scions or agents, but for a group of PCs not connected to the house, the hydra can be a dangerous foe. As deadly as a Phiarlan assassin might be, the greatest weapon of the house is information. PCs who are dealing with a wealthy enemy might have their plans spied or scryed upon by Phiarlan agents, providing advance warning and knowledge of the party's weaknesses.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Organizations in House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan as an Organization]{House Phiarlan as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{People of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Spirit Keepers]{Spirit Keepers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan in the World]{House Phiarlan in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Phiarlan]{Playing a Member of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_v6ohxlugu8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Where it caters to teamsters and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Cogs]{Cogs} workers, Dragoneyes is a rough-and-tumble neighborhood filled with rowdy taverns and gambling halls. But the west side of the district is designed with merchants and the wealthy in mind, and the delights it offers are more sophisticated.​</p>\n<p>Dragoneyes has a number of inns, taverns, and restaurants aimed toward frequent travelers passing through @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. But there is no reason a visitor should have to dine or sleep alone. The streets are full of people of all races and genders offering companionship. Wise people avoid these freelance operatives— who are often thieves or con artists looking for an opportunity—and instead frequent one of the many brothels in the district. Dragoneyes also contains a handful of dream parlors, places where illusion magic is used to provide exotic entertainment.​</p>\n<p>Dragoneyes is the base of operations of the Tyrants, a guild of deception run by doppelgangers and changelings. The Tyrants manage to walk a fine line, dealing with both Daask and the Boromar Clan to provide the people of Dragoneyes with dreamlily and dragon’s blood.​</p>\n<h2>Dragon Eyes at a Glance</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Quarter:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tavick's Landing]{Tavick's Landing}</li>\n<li><strong>Ward:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Tavick's]{Lower Tavick's}</li>\n<li><strong>District Type: </strong>Red light</li>\n<li><strong>Buildings: </strong>​Temple (@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Olladra]{Olladra}), shrine (@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Traveler]{the Traveler}), upscale lodging (Velvet’s) (1), average lodging (9), poor lodging (70), average food (20), poor food (80), poor trades (80), poor services (especially brothels, gambling halls, and pawnshops) (140), poor residences (100)​</li>\n<li><strong>First Impression: </strong>​This district varies dramatically from street to street, blending loud, lowbrow entertainment with more sophisticated and sensual pleasures for wealthier visitors.​</li>\n<li><strong>Social Class:</strong> Lower class</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragon Eyes Highlights</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"black-row\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"2\">Locations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chances Casino</td>\n<td>A legendary gambling hall.

In addition to running the standard games and making odds on the various races and sporting events that occur throughout the city, Chances Casino has a reputation for being able to arrange and cover almost any bet. Can you survive for two days with House Tarkanan trying to assassinate you? Can you seduce the ambassador from Aerenal in the next 24 hours? Chances Casino makes the odds, takes the bet, and makes the arrangements required to set the challenge in motion. ​</p>\n<h3>Velvet's</h3>\n<p>​This luxurious inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies. While companions of all races and genders can be found here (though most are in fact doppelgangers or changelings), a client can enjoy the company of anyone he or she desires. A portrait is preferred, but Velvet can pluck images from the mind of a client, drawing out appearance, mannerisms, and other desired traits. The appearance of rooms can be adjusted to fulfill a specific scenario. While companionship is certainly sold at Velvet’s, it is not always what people want. A client may want to practice a wedding proposal. A barrister may go to Velvet’s to relive a glorious triumph in the courtroom. A lonely traveler may want to spend one night at home with his wife and family, even if they are only facsimiles. Velvet’s can make all of these happen. The cost of such elaborate scenarios is considerably higher than a standard inn or brothel, but Velvet’s does provide an experience that cannot be found anywhere else.​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_86zoy3izpgi","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The guild was dedicated to finding ways to replicating the mystical powers of the fey through arcane science. Members specialize in illusion, enchantment, divination, and magic related directly to the fey, and the Guild is an exceptional source of knowledge regarding fey and archfey.</p>\n<p>Moonlight isn't a large circle, in part because of its extremely high standards. However, it is the most widely respected circle in Aundair, in part because Princess Aundair was herself a member of Moonlight and Whispers.

Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Keeper]{the Keeper} of the Dark Six.</p>\n<p>Kol Korran is the god of trade, wealth, and commerce. He is the only second-generation member of the Sovereign Host, which is appropriate since wealth and trade appear only after the other elements of society fall into place. As the most avaricious of the Host, Kol Korran is patron to merchants, traders, and all who seek wealth; in his darker aspect, he is also the patron of thieves and fences. He is loyal to the Host, but some legends ascribe to him a sense of resentment and a feeling that the other gods do not consider him an equal.

{"_id":"GRr6ExNiXOkPOzpo","name":"Sharn in the Aftermath of the Last War","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Sharn in the Aftermath of War</h1>\n<p>Far from the front lines, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.</p>\n<h3>Physical Damage</h3>\n<p>Although @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the district now known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Fallen]{Fallen}. In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.</p>\n<h3>Psychological Scars</h3>\n<p>There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura} hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Fallen]{Fallen}. In another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for the siege of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Vathirond]{Vathirond}. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} front during the war might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged soldiers might resent all such creatures.</p>\n<h3>Shortages</h3>\n<p>Because the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships between the signatories are still being normalized, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} doesn't currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.</p>\n<h3>Refugees and Victims</h3>\n<p>Cyran refugees have filled the district of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.High Walls]{High Walls} in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Tavick's]{Lower Tavick's} Landing beyond capacity, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} is also home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ggzl5wksbsl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"HrrbmNri785oqqcl","name":"Elemental Vessels","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Elemental Vessels</h1>\n<p>Long ago, gnome artificers and specialists from House Cannith discovered and developed a means of magical travel. The heart of the process is a set of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into the vessel's hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for any amount of compensation.</p>\n<p>The construction of elemental vessels requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle's helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.</p>\n<h3>Elemental Matrix</h3>\n<p>Every elemental vessel is imbued with an invisible, arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through the rest of the vehicle's hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins of a living creature.</p>\n<p>The binding struts force the elemental into a ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its ship.</p>\n<p>At the command of the vehicle's dragonmarked pilot, the bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.</p>\n<h3>Controlling the Elemental</h3>\n<p>Piloting an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle's movement, and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves according to the elemental's whim until a pilot asserts control again.</p>\n<p>A dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental easily. Without such a pilot, it's very difficult to control the vessel. A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel's helm can try to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.</p>\n<p>A character can make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check to persuade the elemental to cooperate or demand its obedience.

{"_id":"Hzff1Z2kdCIIQwLX","name":"Cyre: Before the Mourning","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Cyre: Before the Mourning</h1>\n<p>The Jewel in Galifar’s Crown. Wondrous Cyre. Cyre was the heart of the united kingdom of Galifar. But what was the nation actually like? Since Cyre has fallen, lore often focuses on the current plight of the refugees and not on the nation they lost. As a Cyran character, what are the memories you treasure? What was your childhood like? If you hope to rebuild your nation, what is it that you aspire to recreate?</p>\n<h2>What our DreaMs iMagine</h2>\n<p>Galifar Wynarn was a military genius, but it was his eldest daughter Cyre, twin to Aundair, who imagined the warring nations working together as a single family: Karrnathi might, Daskari faith, and the wisdom of Thaliost working together for the greater good. In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows—the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future. Cyre’s motto captures the heart of this nation and its people: “What our dreams imagine, our hands create.”</p>\n<p>The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King’s Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together—the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the everbright lantern, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece—a city of wonders— this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.</p>\n<p>This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever. The people of Cyre can trace their roots to all of these nations, believing they share these strengths; and beyond that, Cyrans strive to be creative, innovative, and artistic.</p>\n<p>Cyre’s artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith’s greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It’s said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There’s no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. “What our dreams imagine, our hands create,” but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.</p>\n<p>This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar’s traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch’s children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.</p>\n<h3>Outer Cyre</h3>\n<p>Galifar’s goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol—which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland—the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre’s dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.</p>\n<p><strong>Southern Cyre</strong> covered what is now @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}. Largely unsettled when Galifar was founded, it persisted as a backwater in the shadow of the kingdom. Its people ultimately prospered and took pride in their identity as Cyrans, mimicking the customs of the central kingdom. However, they had little of the wealth invested in the north or the wonders that came with it. There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal’dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.</p>\n<p><strong>Eastern Cyre</strong>—now @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}—was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar’s greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}; first and foremost, it’s because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called “thrones”), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_xx0xvw5uv7q","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"ID2sIJw4vOJVikEb","name":"Droaam: Law and Order","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Law and Order</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall], the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers—anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}—but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.</p>\n<p>In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.</p>\n<p>There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it—but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice—but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.</p>\n<p>Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Xor'chylic}, the illithid warlord of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}, has granted Kundran Torrn of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} the right to prosecute crimes committed in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.</p>\n<p>A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; everyone clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her—he needs to know better—but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: What Defines Droaam?]{What Defines Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam]{Political Structure of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Law and Order]{Law and Order}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Religion in Droaam]{Religion in Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?]{Why Go to Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Economy of Droaam]{Economy of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Power Groups}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The stamp of the gorgon—the symbol of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}—is a sign of good quality and reasonable price, and can be found on items as varied as horseshoes, longsword hilts, and watertight barrels.</p>\n<p>The guild maintains some retail establishments, but it is largely content to focus on production and leave the selling to others. Cannith goods can be found everywhere, both in the emporiums of Khorvaire's largest cities and in the general stores on the edges of civilization.</p>\n<h2>Tinkers Guild</h2>\n<p>Harkening back to the Cannith family's original profession, members of this guild go from town to town, using magic to repair broken or damaged items. Much of Cannith's popularity among those who do not have dragon marks can be attributed to periodic visits from Cannith tinkers. House elders maintain that the wandering life of a tinker is a character-building exercise, and most of the important dragon marked heirs spend some of their adolescence traveling among the tinkers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

But most court observers say there's a simpler reason for Trelib's omnipresence. King Boranel has charged Trelib with figuring out who murdered Boranel's first wife, Queen Chaseva. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} elders know that Trelib is consumed with finding the killer, even to the point of neglecting house business.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Taldor d'Medani: </strong>Taldor leads the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Basilisk's Gaze}, a group charged with hunting war criminals from the Last War.

The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Thousand Yard Stare} is stretched to the limit, and Channara regards every Mournland monster that makes it into @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} as a personal failure.\n<p>Channara is also aware that the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Thousand Yard Stare} doesn't venture far into the Mournland.

He guides both mundane smiths and artificers, inspiring anyone who performs an act of creation. Dwarves in particular revere him.</p>\n<p>Without Onatar, the civilized races could never have risen above the beasts to build communities and societies. He is the god of the forge, of craft and industry, and also of fire. He first inspired mortals to build tools and weapons, and then to improve on those already built.

We know that the Ring is comprised of siberys dragonshards, because it’s where those dragonshards come from. Most fallen shards are quite small, but it’s there are definitely larger shards in the Ring; the civilization of the Qabalrin elves of Xen’drik was destroyed when the Ring of Storms was struck by a massive dragonshard now known as the Heart of Siberys. It’s possible that the entire ring is made up of pure dragonshards, or it could be that there are shards embedded in a more inert material—perhaps the petrified flesh of an ancient cosmic dragon.</p>\n<p>One of the more popular schools of arcane thought maintains that all arcane magic (and perhaps divine magic as well) manipulates energy that radiates from the Ring—that magic itself is the “Blood of Siberys.” Whether or not this is true, siberys dragonshards are an extremely valuable resource. Siberys shards are used for dragonmark focus items, but per  they are also used for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts. A nation or house that can secure a reliable source of siberys shards will have a huge advantage in advancing arcane science.</p>\n<p>It’s also possible that an outpost in the Ring could harness the ambient energy of the Ring itself to perform epic magic.

Before the Last War, Orien's influence blanketed the continent, and its trade roads and lightning rails were the lifeblood of a kingdom. The war cut those arteries, however, leaving Galifar dead and House Orien bloodied but unbowed. The loss of Cyre was as devastating for Orien as it was for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith}, but you know that someday your house will regain its losses. It's just a question of when.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/orien-blade-guard.webp\" width=\"292\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>As a member of House Orien, you view combat as an unusual hazard, not a part of your daily routine. A fight is often an ambush, especially for those in the guilds. As such, once in combat, you seek to get out of it as quickly as possible. Whether this means avoiding it, escaping it, or putting a quick end to it is up to you. When combat is inevitable, your preferred tactic is to take control of the field. The teleport abilities of the Mark of Passage lend themselves to this approach, but you will use any means possible (from magic to alchemical items) to disorient and overwhelm your foes.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>As a member of House Orien, your concerns are your house, your guilds, and your person, in that order. Advancement within the house and the guilds is driven by actions that support the health and growth of Orien. However, it is possible to advance in the house without advancing in a guild, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>House Orien emphasizes training future leaders, and if real-world experience or a particular course of study might benefit the house, Orien is usually willing to fund a portion of the expenses. This expenditure of resources is seen as an investment, and it is expected that those receiving such aid will repay the house with time and labor. As a member of House Orien, you have a mix of economic ambition and social concern. The Transportation</p>\n<p>Guild is as much a public service as a business in Khorvaire and, as a result, you sometimes find the commercial focus of the other houses undignified or shortsighted. Short-term exigencies might force your hand, but your projects require long-term planning. A certain amount of patience is necessary.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>As a member of House Orien, your work touches on the operation of both the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Coutiers Guild} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Transportation Guild}. When caravans are attacked, problems arise on the lightning rail line, or a courier goes missing, investigators are dispatched. With the freedom to travel almost anywhere in Khorvaire, a house assignment could see you scouting the borders of the Mournland, searching @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} for black-market conductor stones, or tracking stolen documents from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} and back again. Your role in any house assignment depends on your class and experience, but will more likely involve recovery and reporting than infiltration or combat.</p>\n<h2>House Orien Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Organizations in House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]{House Orien as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{People of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien in the World]{House Orien in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Orien]{Playing a Member of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.By Road and Rail]{By Road and Rail}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_wcf9z2v1mgb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Work hard and don't complain.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the tales of the Exile, Lanarak and Londurak are siblings. Farmers and brewers, they’re all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they’re both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense—to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there’s a decent chance that if a bartender’s a dwarf, they’re from one of these two clans.</p>\n<p>While Lanarak and Londurak don’t mine metals, both traditionally farm mushrooms and red pudding in deep caverns, and both were drawn into the War Below. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades—outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats. It’s rare for dwarves from these valley clans to take risks or to leave the holds, but a remarkable folk hero or sailor could hear the call of adventure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"KoeHuy9Y51BNkMS5","name":"Playing a Dragonmarked Heir","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Playing a Dragonmarked Heir</h1>\n</div>\n<p>A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Mark of Making} guides the hands of the smith, while the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadows} helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storms} can scatter enemies with a blast of wind, while the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadows} can weave illusions.</p>\n<p>No one can buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines within specific species. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence when put through the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys], though not every heir manifests the mark.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses.

This control over vital services gives the houses tremendous power.</p>\n<p>In the past, the dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar. But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the power to enforce its wishes on the houses.</p>\n<p>The adventurer has a dragonmark as appropriate to his race, and is considered a dragonmarked heir. The dragonmark grants the a power from those available to the a particular Mark. In addition a bonus to one skill used by heirs of that dragonmark. The dragonmark grants the ability to use dragonmark focus items and a power granted by that specific mark.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent.</strong> You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Scion. </strong>You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadows}, sailor for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storms}, soldier for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Mark of Sentinel}, sage for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriate. </strong>When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</li>\n<li><strong>Foundling. </strong>Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand.

{"_id":"Ks1E30GmA8JL7PDv","name":"Graywall: Life in Graywall","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Life in Graywall</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk] and the warbands raiding @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]. With the war’s end, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell] have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]. As a result, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east—bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It’s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago—especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h2>Common Customs</h2>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] serve @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]— but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa’s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Xor'chylic} has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cazhaak Draal] have sent envoys to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall], but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} and Little @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall], and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage—an interpretation of the Fury—while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone}.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] over the last four centuries, and the people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, generally all people the hero talks too will start at Unfriendly on the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Reaction Table]. The hero will have a –4 on all @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} checks, and any perceived allies of his take a –2 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h2>Law and Order</h2>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/droaam/xorchylic-speaking-to-crowd-in-graywall.webp\" /></div>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam], this is Xor'chylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xor'chylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xor'chylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk].</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don’t do anything that directly inconveniences Xor'chylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xor'chylic doesn’t recognize the laws of other lands and won’t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xor'chylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It’s said that Xor'chylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light—but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xor'chylic has granted @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk] the right to prosecute crimes committed in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}. Baron Kundran Torrn of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk] can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h2>The Economy</h2>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don’t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/droaam/dragonne-in-calebas.webp\" /></div>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam's] markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group’s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade—although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn’t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. As a result, the markets of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC—but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam's] primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] to deal in less savory goods. Bandits—both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters—sell their spoils in the goblin markets. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon’s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim’s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\n<p>Beyond the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}, the people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it’s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a “songbird.” When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty. </p>\n<h2>Food and Drink</h2>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}. If he ventures into @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} or the other districts of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall], he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]ites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner’s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as “grist mills.” This name is drawn from the primary dish—a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

No other house directly touches as many lives, whether through the lightning rail that once connected the great cities of the Five Nations, the caravans that traverse rural lands, or the couriers who deliver letters and packages virtually anywhere.</p>\n<p>House Orien's businesses have been pervasive (and profitable) since before the first appearance of the Mark of Passage. However, the Last War took a heavy toll on this house—one from which it has yet to recover. After decades of effort, House Orien had spanned the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]{Five Nations} with its lightning rail, but the war and the Day of Mourning shattered the house's intercontinental links. Today, the organization is bent on recovery, but fresh competition from House Lyrandar and the instability of Khorvaire's new age are challenges the house has yet to overcome.</p>\n<p>Members of House Orien carry the Mark of Passage, and they dominate the business of overland travel. From caravan trains to couriers, the members of House Orien are the masters of the road. Their trade has little glamor, and the denizens of House Orien are practical, with no patience for arrogance or conceit. But they are proud: They have kept the lines of trade flowing across Khorvaire for nearly 2,000 years. Although only humans carry the Mark of Passage, House Orien is a cosmopolitan house: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{Elves}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{half-elves}, eladrin, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orcs}, and even @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Changeling]{changelings} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shifter]{shifters} have all married into the line over time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Trade Roads:</strong> Centuries before the creation of the lightning rail, House Orien built the major trade roads connecting the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Rune-carved stones are buried beneath the surface of these roads. Orien's caravans and the tack of their messengers' mounts are inscribed with arcane sigils. A bearer of the Mark of Passage can perform a ritual to increase the speed of a caravan or a mount that travels these roads.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lightning Rail: </strong>Since its creation in 811 YK, the lightning rail has been the symbol of House Orien. Faster than any caravan, it is a safe and secure method for transporting goods and people across Khorvaire. Only a bearer of the Mark of Passage can control the elemental that powers a coach. Many lightning rail lines were damaged during the Last War, and the house is still rebuilding the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleportation: </strong>Orien's First Step magewrights are the foremost experts on teleportation in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. They developed the Linked Portal ritual, and most permanent teleportation circles in Khorvaire are Orien's. However, teleportation is still a fledgling science, and many people are nervous about using it; a ride on a lightning rail or a Lyrandar elemental airship might take longer, but it is seen as safer.</p>\n<h2>House Orien Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Organizations in House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]{House Orien as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{People of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien in the World]{House Orien in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Orien]{Playing a Member of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.By Road and Rail]{By Road and Rail}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-orien-coa.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>The Mark of Passage appeared in the region of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair} about 1,900 years ago. The merchants and teamsters who developed the mark were experienced travelers who soon discovered their common bond. Initially, there was some competition between the marked families, but members soon realized what they could accomplish by working together.</p>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and diplomacy, House Orien secured safe passage for its caravans. As its fortunes grew, the house improved existing roads and developed new ones. In the days before the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Sivis} speaking stone network, House Orien ran a post system that was used across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]{Five Nations}.</p>\n<p>The lightning rail was developed with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and the elemental binders of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. This technology revolutionized House Orien's business, and soon the Trailblazers were laying conductor stones across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> The Last War was difficult for House Orien. Bridges were destroyed. Lightning rail lines were broken. And toward the end of the war, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} took to the air. House Orien's dominance in the field of transportation is no longer assured. With this changing situation in mind, House Orien has redoubled its work with teleportation.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{Baron Kwanti d'Orien}: </strong>Head of House Orien who is a dynamic leader that hates to stay in one place.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{Jaunt}:</strong> An eladrin that is one of the most repected wizards of the First Step.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p>House Orien is one of the most widespread of the houses, with outposts across Khorvaire.

These way stations primarily support the caravans that pass through, but they are also trading posts. The original Orien families were merchants as well as teamsters, after all.

{"_id":"LNi22AHHhPVd6Qaa","name":"Stonesingers","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Stonesingers</h1>\n<p>The Lorghali produce excellent mediators, apothecaries, and farmers. But what makes them truly remarkable is their tradition of primal magic and their relationship with the elementals of the region. The elementals of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lamannia]{Lamannia} are alien creatures whose thought processes and perception of reality are quite different from those of the humanoids of Eberron. Rather than binding elementals, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorgahlen} stonesingers manipulate elementals and natural forces by communing directly with the spirit and convincing it to help. This is barely more complicated than singing a few words in Primordial. More significant requests require a deeper communion with the spirits, which requires both concentration and an expenditure of will in addition to the song—urging the spirit to comply, impressing the request onto it. These things thus carry all the standard limitations of casting a spell.</p>\n<p>The most common and important work of a stonesinger is to work with elementals. On a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorgahlen} ship, a stonesinger literally sings to the elemental associated with the ship, encouraging it to move the vessel swiftly. If the stonesingers are killed, the elemental will still recognize the vessel as friendly, but it can't be compelled to perform any particular action and it may simply wander off. On the island, stonesingers negotiate with the elementals to establish the territories where the gnomes can build, and convince earth elementals to plow their fields and water elementals to provide irrigation. Remarkable stonesingers can manipulate elemental and natural forces in more subtle ways—charming beasts, encouraging plants to grow, even conjuring fire or drawing lightning from a clear sky. Others learn the melodies that define their own bodies, learning how to heal injuries or even change their shape. Almost every @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorgahlen} gnome knows at least a few simple songs, but those who can work greater magics—those with the powers of bards or druids, discussed in more detail below—are greatly respected. While the stonesingers are a unique tradition that plays a central role in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorgahlen} culture, they have nothing against other forms of magic; in particular, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorgahlen} alchemists are able to perform wonders using the unusual plants of their island. The original immigrants included a handful of dissidents from the families of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, and while the Lorghali have made no particular effort to cultivate the Mark of Scribing, there are still a few gnomes in each generation who manifest the mark; such gnomes often become the most gifted wizards of the island.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Over the last few decades, a tradition has built up around this day. Crafters carve ice sculptures, creating beautiful miniature towers, and then hurl them into the Dagger River.

Named for the nearmythic explorer who led the humans to Khorvaire some three thousand years ago, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} have always been grouped together—even though the individual princes rarely see themselves as part of a greater whole.</p>\n<p>The Principalities developed during the same period when the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} were formed, more than a thousand years before the birth of Galifar. By the time King Galifar I was uniting the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, the Principalities were well established, as was their inhabitants’ well-deserved reputation as raiders and pirates. When Galifar proclaimed that his kingdom “stretched across the width and breadth of Khorvaire,” the Lhazaar princes ignored him. Their domains were far from the great cities of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, separated by a formidable mountain range and the endless seas over which the princes ruled supreme.</p>\n<p>By 28 YK, King Galifar had fortified his hold over the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and turned his attention to the threat from the east. The Lhazaar princes and sea barons were wreaking havoc among the coastal communities, interfering with shipping and refusing to bend to the will of the crown. Thus began the Galifar–Lhazaar War, a series of naval engagements that lasted nearly a decade. The sea barons knew the currents better and started out with better vessels, but Galifar dedicated his efforts to building a powerful navy. Aided by magic and the help of some of the dragonmarked houses, Galifar was able to garner enough victories to force the Lhazaar princes to meet to discuss terms. In the end, the Principalities became part of Galifar’s kingdom but remained autonomous, the Lhazaar princes more or less independent within their own domains yet agreeing to pay tribute to Galifar and recognize him as the legitimate ruler of the mainland kingdom.</p>\n<p>For the next eight hundred years, the Lhazaar princes continued to live in relative harmony with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Lhazaar pirates slowly developed into traders and explorers, keeping their illicit activities to a minimum so as not to attract the attention of Galifar’s ever-improving navy. When the Last War broke out, the Lhazaar princes initially stayed out of the fray. As the months of conflict and unresolved issues of rulership wore on, the princes decided that their longstanding agreement was with the united Galifar, not the individual successor kingdoms. With the kingdom shattered, the princes felt no obligation to honor the ancient pact.</p>\n<p>During the century of conflict, the Lhazaar princes one by one reverted to their ancient ways. First, the princes (and their subjects) fought against each other for dominance in the Principalities. Then they turned their sights toward more lucrative prey. Throughout the war, Lhazaar ships engaged in piracy, hired out as privateers, and began to carve out their own pieces from the corpse of the oncegreat kingdom. Under the leadership of Prince Ryger ir’Wynarn, who claims that the royal blood of Galifar flows through his veins, the Principalities settled their own differences long enough to present a united front at the peace treaty talks on Thronehold.</p>\n<p>Now, with the Principalities recognized as a legitimate confederacy by the rest of Khorvaire, the princes have once again traded their pirate flags for the colors of merchants—at least outwardly (what may be a merchant vessel today can switch its flag and sail as a pirate or raiding vessel tomorrow). Prince Ryger is determined to unite the Principalities and create a naval force the likes of which Khorvaire has never seen before. Then, whatever happens on the mainland, the Principalities will be safe, secure, and powerful beyond imagining. Unfortunately, none of the other princes are quite ready to bend their knees to Ryger, and so his dream remains unfulfilled.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Unless there is no other alternative, he only performs magic in the depths of the temple. He takes the use of magic very seriously, and rarely uses spells even to help his parishioners. He believes that people should be able to solve their own problems, and while he offers spiritual advice and even financial assistance to other members of the community, he only uses magic for the most serious situations. ​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_86zoy3izpgi","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Always willing to help a friend in need, and always willing to make a new friend.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Like Lanarak and Londurak, the mythic founders of Clans Toldorath and Tordannon were siblings. Unlike their fellow exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both. Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They’re stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans—to family, clan, and the holds themselves.</p>\n<p>But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash’tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy—the modern Jhorash’tar aren’t particularly adept healers—but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash’tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.</p>\n<p>Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and fighters, hunters and rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it’s always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Between the magic of the mark and its members' natural inventiveness, Clan Cannith steadily increased its power and influence, creating its own areas of jurisdiction throughout Cyre and central Khorvaire. An active and enthusiastic participant in the War of the Mark, House Cannith found itself one of the most powerful of the dragonmarked houses after the war.</p>\n<p>House Cannith used that power to forge partnerships. At the end of the War of the Mark, House Cannith worked with the other dragonmarked houses to establish the Twelve. They allied with the elemental binders of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and the scions of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} to create elemental ships to sail Eberron's seas. Emboldened by that success, House Cannith's magewrights collaborated with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} on the lightning rail. House Cannith also helped to establish the network of message stations that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} uses to facilitate communication across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> When the Last War began, House Cannith found itself acting as arms dealer to all five of the combatant nations, a position that allowed it to amass fantastic wealth and an unparalleled degree of influence among the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. But selling weapons and armor was only the beginning. In 965 YK, the first warforged soldiers marched out of Cannith's forgehold at Whitehearth, and soon House Cannith was supplying not only weapons but also the soldiers that wielded them.</p>\n<p>House Cannith's unbounded prosperity lasted almost thirty years. But in a single moment on the Day of Mourning, House Cannith lost its leader, Baron Starrin d'Cannith, many of its dragon marked heirs, and the Whitehearth forgehold. The Treaty of Thronehold made matters worse for the house, because it set the warforged free and banned House Cannith from making more. With the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} at peace, Cannith's role as arms dealer to the world diminished.</p>\n<p>These recent setbacks have made House Cannith's leaders more determined than ever before to reverse the house's fortunes, and have highlighted the rivalry among the house's leadership. At any given moment, Cannith's inventors are sequestered in secret laboratories across Khorvaire, trying to create something even more dramatically world-changing than the towers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Orien Lightning Rail]{lightning rail}, or the warforged.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Jorlanna d'Cannith}: </strong>The daughter of Starrin's second wife and leader of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Merrix d'Cannith}: </strong>Merrix is the grandson of the creator of the first warforged and Starrin's grandnephew. leader of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Zorlan d'Cannith}: </strong>Starrin's cousin was Zorlan's mother and was once one of Starrin's chief financial advisors.

Because inventors and artisans who have the Mark of Making are reluctant to destroy their own creations, the vaults within this forgehold contain failed experiments, dangerous concoctions, and strange devices that the Canniths have locked away for future study.</p>\n<p>House Cannith has a second enclave in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragon Towers]{Dragon Towers} district of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} that Merrix d'Cannith uses for diplomatic purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Aundair Enclave:</strong> A sprawling villa just outside Fairhaven, Cannith's enclave in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair} is home to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Jorlanna d'Cannith}. This enclave has almost as many libraries and map rooms as it does laboratories and workshops. Under particular study are some rare plants and ancient treasures brought back from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}—the result of Jorlanna's influence with the druids of the Wardens of the Wood.</p>\n<p><strong>Korth Enclave: </strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Zorlan d'Cannith} is nominally in charge of this enclave, but many of Jorlanna's functionaries (and sometimes Jorlanna herself) spend time in Korth because the Council of the Twelve is headquartered here. This walled compound is the site of much scheming among the factions of House Cannith.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/house-cannith-artificer.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Today, these proud stonefolk know all too well that when battles must be fought, few respond as brutally and as efficiently as the Mror dwarves. As a result, few houses try harder than Kundarak to avoid conflict, and characters are more likely to encounter @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} by seeking its assistance than running afoul of its plans. In all things, the house sees unity, not conflict, as the means to success.</p>\n<p>The manticore that adorns the Kundarak seal is the symbol of an old legend. In the early days of the dwarves' exile, the manticores of the Ironroot Mountains were dispassionate observers of the conflict between clans. Then, in early skirmishes between the clans and the Jhorash'tar orcs, the dwarves found themselves steadily pushed back under waves of orc infantry better suited to fighting on the steep mountain slopes. Faced with a real possibility that the clans might not survive a coming midwinter assault, the Kundarak set out to forge an alliance with the manticores. In exchange for magically warding their mountain lairs against the aberrations that hunted there, Kundarak got these creatures to agree to aid the dwarves' cause.</p>\n<p>When the Jhorash'tar assault came, it was met not only by dwarf axes on the ground but by manticores and their crossbow-wielding riders in the air. The orc threat was turned back, and the relationship between the dwarves and the Ironroot manticores has been strong ever since.</p>\n<p>The Kundarak dwarves hail from an ancient clan structure. As a result, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} is organized somewhat differently from the system of viceroys, ministers, and seneschals that has become the standard of dragonmarked hierarchy.</p>\n<p>The current head of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{Morrikan d'Kundarak} (LN male dwarf aristocrat 3/fighter 9/heir of Siberys 2), referred to as baron by those outside the house and as lord by those within it. Titles and positions within the house are hereditary, and are always passed down from father to son (or, in rare cases, to nephew) within the Kundarak line. Lord Morrikan is a shrewd and patient patriarch who has ruled his house for over a century. When the Last War broke out, Morrikan's voice from his observer's seat at the Iron Council was said to be the first to whisper of independence.</p>\n<p>Below the lord are two additional positions of authority. Chieftain is another hereditary title, borne by the ranking member of a non-Kundarak bloodline within the house. Six house chieftains rule at any given time. Because the bloodlines within the house operate primarily in their own geographic areas across Khorvaire, chieftains end up taking on the standard role of viceroys within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}. Lord Kundarak is the chieftain for his own bloodline, and thus acts as viceroy for the house in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}.</p>\n<p>In ancient times, the hearthwarden was responsible for “keeping the house” of the clan. Today, the title is held by the administrator of a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} enclave. The majority of hearthwardens are female, and most are spellcasters. Hearthwardens are elected from within the house, but must be approved by the house lord.</p>\n<p>In addition to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Warding Guild's} @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Iron Gate} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Golden Door}, the house maintains two lesser-known orders not affiliated with guilds. The Keyguard are often believed to be a subdivision of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Golden Door}, and thus controlled by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Warding Guild}. The truth is that one can obtain the services of the Keyguard only from the house. The missions of this elite corps of sneaks and security specialists are decided at the upper levels of the house hierarchy. See the silver key prestige class on page 120 for more information.</p>\n<p>The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Ghorad'din} (“manticore's tail”) is the secret paramilitary arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}. Outside the house, few have heard of it, and all but a small handful of those are dwarves of other clans. Called into service only rarely, the Ghorad'din is the closest that Kundarak has to a force of house assassins.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} is composed of nine bloodlines, including the Kundarak, the Durbannek, the Ghedin, and the Tuvodni. All nine can trace their lineage back to the first wardens who gained the surface world alongside the exiled clans.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} has worked long and hard to establish its reputation. As a result, it has few enemies among the civilized races. Individuals might have a hostile reaction toward the house (being turned down for a loan can do that), but just as many work hard to impress a Kundarak upon first meeting. Due to Kundarak's relationship with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, most gnomes begin with a friendly attitude toward members of the house.</p>\n<p>Though Kundarak claims neutrality in its dealings with the other dwarf clans, it wields great influence over the affairs of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. As such, the reaction of a clan dwarf to a member of the house depends less on any real relationship between house and clan than it does on what Kundarak is rumored to be up to. Only when a Kundarak faces some threat from outside the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds} will members of all the clans typically come to his aid.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The first and greatest @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} enclave is the stronghold of Korunda Gate, nestled high in the mountains of Kundarakhold. Nearly twenty thousand dwarves make their homes here, giving the house its own standing army should it ever need one. In the event that Kundarak's martial and magical prowess proves insufficient (a toe-curling thought), residents of Korunda Gate can flee to the extensive vaults beneath the city, where much of the house's wealth—and that of select clients—is stored.</p>\n<p>Korunda Gate is large enough to require not just one, but an entire council of hearthwardens. All political, legal, and executive decisions still rest with Lord Kundarak and his family, but the council administers the day-to-day operations of the city as an enclave. The head of this council is given the honorific of matron, a position presently held by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{Matron Jakela Tuvodni} (LN female dwarf aristocrat 1/wizard 7/dragonmark heir 4), the stern but much beloved “hearthwarden of hearthwardens.”</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>The heirs of Kundarak are polite to a fault, particularly when dealing with potential clients or members of the other dragonmarked houses.

This is not to say that those of the house do not have their own ambitions and agendas, but all of Kundarak understands the critical importance of appearance.</p>\n<p>Given the goods and services in which the house specializes, Kundarak heirs are often called on as security specialists, undertaking missions that easily dovetail into further adventures.

{"_id":"N8CsLTzGtCZOUNJ3","name":"Risia","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Risia</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Plain of Ice</h2>\n<p>Risia is known as the Plain of Ice, for that’s the vast majority of what’s found within it. Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. But like Fernia, Risia’s appearance can be deceiving. Because it’s filled with glaciers and snow, many sages assume that this is its defining principle. But in Lamannia, there are also endless blizzards and majestic glaciers— ice in its natural state. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn’t about snow, it’s about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that’s the point of it; it’s bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point—but is now caught, frozen, stagnant.</p>\n<p>Though this isolated and unchanging plane might not seem appealing to adventurers, it’s important to remember that the plane represents preservation—and ancient secrets forgotten for ages could be frozen within the ice. And while the realm itself is barren, it’s not completely deserted; over millennia, hardy creatures have come to Risia and settled in this desolate realm.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Risia is bitterly cold, and unprotected creatures quickly succumb to the deadly temperatures. Here are a few of the consistent properties of the plane.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/risia-symbol.webp\" width=\"343\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lethal Cold. </strong>A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 10 minutes or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that’s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowered Ice.</strong> When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals cold damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.</p>\n<p><strong>Preservation. </strong>A creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn, entering a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it’s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn’t grow older.</p>\n<p><strong>Stagnation.</strong> When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesn’t regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Stillness of Flesh.</strong> Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature’s body, and creatures don’t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and don’t immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property’s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways Risia can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>ManiFesT zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones to Risia are often found in cold or arctic regions, where their impact isn’t immediately obvious. In warmer climes, most manifest zones tied to Risia create regions of unnatural cold, often taking on the plane’s Lethal Cold and Empowered Ice properties of the plane, regardless of the regional climate.</p>\n<p>In a few Risian zones, the effects of Stillness of Flesh can be felt, slowing or completely stopping the aging, growth, and reproduction of all creatures—except for dwarves, that is. While a manifest zone that prevents aging could be otherwise considered quite a boon, these zones can be quite small, and often tied to deadly cold that makes it difficult to live there. It’s unusual for a Risian zone to transport people to Risia, but it can happen when the planes are coterminous.</p>\n<h3>CoTerMinous and reMoTe</h3>\n<p>While Risia is coterminous, temperatures drop sharply, and areas that would normally be chilly but otherwise safe can take on the Lethal Cold, Empowered Ice, and Stillness of Flesh universal properties. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense cold can be unexpectedly transported to Risia. However, this effect is unpredictable; while it can happen if it serves the story, it’s not something most people are afraid of. When Risia is remote, intense cold loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made against the effects of extreme cold and on saving throws against spells that deal cold damage.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Risia becomes coterminous once every five years for the full month of Zarantyr. Once every five years, exactly two and a half years after it is coterminous, it’s remote during the month of Lharvion. However, this isn’t always the case. Historians have recorded times when the cycle has extended far longer; in 657 YK, Risia entered a coterminous phase that lasted for three years.</p>\n<h3>Risian aRtifacts</h3>\n<p>Risian ice is vivid blue and charged with the essence of the plane. This ice maintains its temperature under any conditions and never melts, even on the Material Plane. An object carved from Risian ice can be used as a spellcasting focus for spells related to ice or water, and it’s a powerful component for creating magical effects related to cold or stasis. While it can develop in both manifest zones and on the plane itself, Risian ice is relatively rare even within Risia; you can’t just find giant sheets of it spread across Frostmantle.</p>\n<p>The frost giants possess magic items and artifacts that they brought with them from Xen’drik, and Il’Ara has surely created new wonders over the years. Adventurers could also find treasures from any civilization there, either buried in the Frozen Sea or still clutched in the hands of people entombed within the ice.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/risia-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_p9kxgvq72wb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

Like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aureon]{Aureon} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Shadow]{thge Shadow}, the Traveler is a source of knowledge. Along with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Olladra]{Olladra} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Mockery]{the Mockery}, it is a patron of those who rely on deception and cunning. Like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Fury]{the Fury}, it can provide inspiration to the artisan. Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it’s because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known. If it helps you deceive, it’s because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis—whether into your life or the lives of others. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} will teach a swordsmith to make a better sword; the Traveler might show them how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn’t here to satisfy your greed or to grant your ambitions. Instead, it will set you on paths you never thought to try. This may sometimes grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you’re inviting the unexpected into your life.</p>\n<p>One of the more infamous Traveler cults within the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} is hidden within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}. While @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} is the acknowledged patron of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, some believe that the Traveler is the source of dramatic inspiration, helping artificers make unforeseen breakthroughs. Those who invoke the Traveler know that its gifts will surely have a cost and could shake the foundations of civilization, but they still yearn for that grand discovery. Many in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} believe that Aaren d’Cannith—the inventor of the warforged—was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.</p>\n<p>Some who follow the Traveler are tricksters, causing chaos with no clear agenda. But others see themselves as guides, playing tricks on people in order to teach them lessons. Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions—not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven’t outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos—for it’s by adapting to this chaos that people grow.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Change, choas, deception, invention, transformation</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Four crossed, rune-inscribed bones</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Scimitar</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> The Traveler’s priests are consummate deceivers.

Instead, its families are spread across hundreds of inns and hostels, any of which can serve as a temporary shelter for a wandering heir. More than any other house, Ghallanda is a ubiquitous presence in the world. Even if a village doesn't have a tavern run by an actual Ghallanda heir, there's a decent chance it has a Ghallanda-licensed inn or hostel, even in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. Adventurers who build a relationship with the house can find allies across Khorvaire, while those who offend an innkeeper do so at their peril. A Ghallanda bartender might not pose a physical threat, but the conversations he has heard and the friends he has made give him far more influence than an adventurer might expect.</p>\n<p>When Ghallanda spread to civilized lands, it adopted the dragonmarked hierarchy established by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}. Every region is governed by a council of viceroys, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{Patriarch Yoren d'Ghallanda} (CG male halfling expert 3/bard 4) leads the house from Gatherhold in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}. One of the oddities of the house is that viceroys often maintain businesses of their own. Yoren himself is a master chef, and spends almost as much time in the kitchens of his great hall as he does in the council chambers.</p>\n<p>On the Plains, an older hierarchy endures in the form of the Wandering Inn. The Ghallanda halflings who make up this traveling fair follow the ways of their tribal ancestors, providing a nomadic place of refuge for the Talenta halflings living outside Gatherhold's walls. Though the Wandering Inn seldom leaves the plains, small splinter groups carrying on its traditions have been encountered in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Q'barra]{Q'barra} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} in recent years. Tales are even told of weary adventurers fleeing the Mournland who have stumbled upon a bright wagon of the Wandering Inn and the safety of the Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion inside.</p>\n<p>The Wandering Inn is largely isolated from the main house. The halflings of the inn abhor the idea of settling in cities, while house heirs outside the plains often consider the life of the Inn to be rough and uncivilized.

Because of the strong economic ties between the houses, members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} are often friendly toward heirs of Ghallanda.</p>\n<p>The presence of the Wandering Inn means that heirs of Ghallanda are usually welcomed by the people of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}. An heir of Ghallanda can improve the attitude of hostile, unfriendly, or indifferent tribal halflings by one category by revealing her dragonmark or offering aid to the tribe. Excoriates and orphans have abused this trust in the past, but the viceroys of the house and the elders of the Wandering Inn go to great lengths to seek out and punish such dishonor.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>House Ghallanda's oldest and most important enclave is the great hall of Gatherhold, on the edge of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}. Located on the eastern shore of Lake Cyre, this area has long been a border between the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the eastern wilds. In the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, the hall became a haven for the adventurers and scholars exploring the eastern Mournland.</p>\n<p>Gatherhold is an ancient cliff dwelling, filled with tunnels and warrens carved into the rocky hills that run along the lake. Patriarch Yoren presides over a great hall at the center of the town, but House Ghallanda maintains the entire community for the nomadic tribes who come and go with the seasons.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} does not run every inn or restaurant, the cheerful halfling barkeep is a common fixture in central Khorvaire. In the wild regions in and around the plains, adventurers might find assistance from members of the Wandering Inn. Whether in the plains or the cities, Ghallanda NPCs can make the quiet moments in an inn or tavern more memorable. If you don't have time to come up with a distinctive hostel for a town the party passes through, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gold Dragon Inn]{Gold Dragon Inn} is there for you. Want a little color? Throw in a Talenta troop performing a traditional dance—with clawfeet in the act.</p>\n<p>The house's interest in networking can make a Ghallanda heir a valuable contact for PCs. If the characters manage to earn the friendship of a Ghallanda innkeeper, they might discover a connection to the black market, a friend of the captain of the city guard, or an envoy capable of arranging a meeting with the mayor. However, an innkeeper who does favors for the party typically asks favors in return, often on behalf of his other friends.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Ghallanda]{Organizations in House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{People of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda as an Organization]{House Ghallanda as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda in the World]{House Ghallanda in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Ghallanda]{Playing a Member of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sign of the Helpful Hound]{Sign of the Helpful Hound}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-ghallanda-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ynwg8edl1rl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"OD3mo6XTNrww0nnJ","name":"Cyran Style","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Cyran Style</h1>\n<p>For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the Epic of Valiant and Vigilant, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.</p>\n<p>Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre—to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there’s always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera—a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it’s a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they’re constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation—that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the “Cyran appreciation.\"</p>\n<p>In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?</p>\n<h2>FaShion</h2>\n<p>Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation—this base layer may be colorful, but it’s first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it’s more functional than decorative.</p>\n<p>After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a glamerweave lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren’t intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with glamerweave). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear—clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?</p>\n<h2>Cuisine</h2>\n<p>Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn’s culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation—adopting new favorites from the place they’ve found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.</p>\n<h2>MagiC</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it’s also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, bard, or wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a wizard who’s studied at the Wynarn Institute, somatic components are almost a dance, while verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_xx0xvw5uv7q","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

In addition, family plays a central role in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}, in the form of the alliance of three great clans: Aashta, Torrn, and Velderan. Each clan controls its own distinct territory, so that challenges within that territory must come from within the ruling clan. Instead of having a single matriarch or patriarch, the house is controlled by the Triumvirate, consisting of one leader (known as a triumvir) from each clan. The current triumvirs are Daric d'Velderan (CG male human ranger 6/dragonmark heir 2), Khundar'aashta (NE male half-orc rogue 6/dragonmark heir 3), and Maagrim Torrn d'Tharashk (N female half-orc druid 7/expert 5/Heir of Siberys 1).

Feuds between clans occasionally have deadly consequences, but the house's leaders have largely managed to keep their kin focused on common goals, and dedicated to maintaining the strength of Tharashk.</p>\n<p>Unknown even to most house members, the Valshar'ak Seal is a union of dedicated Gatekeepers who have vowed to use the resources of Tharashk to fulfill their ancient duties, and to prevent the Dragon Below from doing the same. Maagrim Torrn supports the Seal, but her position as triumvir prevents her from taking an active role with the group. Currently, the Valshar'ak Seal is led by the venerable Urlev Torrn (N male halforc druid 11)</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire are typically indifferent to the members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}.

Dragonmarks normally manifest in response to stress, and each of the houses has developed a battery of trials that are designed to draw out a latent dragonmark. All members of a house bloodline undergo this Test of Siberys during adolescence. Those heirs who don’t develop a dragonmark are presumed not to have it, though some do develop fledgling or Siberys marks later in life.</p>\n<p>The Test of Siberys varies for each dragonmark. The basic principles are the same across a particular mark, but different house enclaves and barons are known to put unique twists on the test, thus keeping the young scions from attempting to duplicate dangerous tests on their own. While the Test of Siberys is specifically designed to trigger a mark, it’s not the only way to force a manifestation. Any stressful situation might trigger a spontaneous manifestation. An heir of a house could develop their mark before being tested, while a foundling born outside of the house could trigger a latent mark by unknowingly replicating the conditions of a Test of Siberys. Additionally, some records reflect accounts of heirs within the true dragonmarked bloodlines manifesting aberrant dragonmarks, much to the dismay of the House.</p>\n<p>Many of the foremost experts on the Draconic Prophecy, like Professors Caldyn and Ennis, hypothesize that such instances are the design of the larger tapestry of fate, and marks appear in completing the necessary steps toward whatever end the Draconic Prophecy declares.</p>\n<p>In creating a dragonmarked character, think about the events that caused your dragonmark to manifest. Did you undergo the Test of Siberys or did your mark manifest independently? The following list looks at just a few of the challenges and forms of stress involved in the Test of Siberys.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection}:</strong> An interview in which a candidate is locked in a room slowly filling with water, faced with two identical subjects and must determine if either, both, or neither are changelings, and the correct answer yields the key to safety. Many applicants manifest the mark simply from the stress of suffocation, even if they fail the requirements of the test. Since that is the true purpose of the test, such successes are praised just as are those who exit the room with dry boots.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Mark of Finding}:</strong> A candidate must track a designated target, often through the Shadow Marches and, depending on the skill of the candidate, such extended hunting might involve ever increasingly dangerous beasts. In a city, the test might involve tracking a House mentor. In either case, failure will bring shame on the family, and could involve injury or death, especially if the prey gets the drop on a would-be hunter.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{Mark of Handling}:</strong> The dragonmark allows its bearer to befriend monstrosities, and the most common test is to be locked in a small space with an angry hippogriff. Candidates might also be faced with a stampede of lesser beasts, challenged to wrangle a herd of cats, or otherwise presented with a difficult task involving the handling animals.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}: </strong>Jorasco heirs are often paired with a small pet for a year before the test. Once the two have had time to bond, they’re locked in a room and the animal is mortally wounded, and it is up to the heir to stabilize the creature and nurse it overnight. At regular intervals, and if the candidate manages to use natural medicine to stabilize the creature, additional wounds are sustained until the dragonmark appears, or the subject expires. If the mark manifests, candidates are innately able to cast spare the dying or some other spell to save their beloved pet. As inhumane as this might appear, Jorasco has one of the highest rates of manifestation among the Dragonmarked bloodlines, and other tests have been theorized but proved ineffective. This practice was deemed more favorable than sending Jorasco heirs into the field during the Last War in hopes that a mark manifests as members of their squad lay dying.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}:</strong> The most common feature of the Mark of Hospitality includes a strong power of persuasion, and the Ghallanda trials largely revolve around high-stakes baking tournaments. In these bake-offs, candidates often aren’t given all the ingredients they require, challenging the heirs to either find a way to overcome this handicap through exceptional talent with cook’s utensils or to convince the judges that the proposed meal was a subpar selection, and the dish presented is more appropriate to suit the pallet given the ingredients, which likely requires the ability to make fast friends.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Mark of Making}:</strong> The heir is stranded in a junk heap with a specific challenge that will allow them to escape imprisonment. To accomplish this, the heir must either mend broken equipment or use magecraft to cobble together something entirely new.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{Mark of Passage}:</strong> Speed is the defining feature of the Mark of Passage, and the candidates are often pitted against each other in foot races to deliver packages to the administrators containing letters of their success, dodging iron defenders while wild beasts are set after them. Those who fall behind might suffer a mauling. As a final safeguard against the crafty candidate, an heir that takes too long to deliver the package also carries with it the mark manifesting stress of the explosive properties infused within the parcel.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}:</strong> Some enclaves focus on the translating abilities of the mark, creating tests that require an immediate translation. An heir could be placed in a dire situation such as being poisoned, or locked in an increasingly inhospitable space, left only with incomprehensible instructions that reveal the keys to survival. Others require a perfect act of scribing, which some might call forgery, perfectly duplicating a challenging piece of writing, such as a legal document. Failing this test could very well mean imprisonment, should the authorities happen upon such replication and detect its imperfections.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Mark of Sentinel}:</strong> Similar to House Jorasco, Sentinel heirs are often paired with dogs or other animals. After a year of bonding, the heir must keep their animal companion alive through a harrowing week of unexpected assaults and hidden threats otherwise impossible without the assistance of a dragonmark.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}:</strong> The heir is sealed in a space with a brutal foe and must successfully evade the enemy for a period. Some enclaves prefer to avoid these tests of stealth and instead focus purely on a display of artistic talent well beyond the level of most professional entertainers.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm}:</strong> The candidate is stranded in a dinghy on storm-tossed water and must make their way safely to land. If the fear of drowning is not enough to awaken the heir’s mark, the fear of being lost at sea is often cited as the catalyst to achieve the desired result.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding}:</strong> A common trial involves heirs being sealed in vaults and abandoned. The candidate works to overcome the locks before succumbing to hunger and thirst. Alternatively, late bloomers might face a dangerous threat approaching in the distance, and the candidate must repair a chamber’s locks and enter before it arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_w20aa8nuflh","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Vadalis rangers and fighters can be encountered across Khorvaire, wherever people are scarce and animals abound. Whether wandering the open road, stationed at remote outposts, or conducting business in small towns across the continent, Vadalis heirs can motivate players to look beyond the cities for their adventures.</p>\n<p>PCs can become involved with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} by joining up with an Orien caravan, either as passengers or hired help. Alternatively, if a marauding beast endangers a settled area, a Vadalis ranger can make an appearance to either control the animal or kill it. Such a character might become an ally of the PCs—or could become competition for a party of adventurers seeking their fortunes in the wilds of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The most famous member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} is technically no longer a member at all. The consort of Queen Aurala of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, Sasik d'Vadalis renounced all position and ties to his house upon marrying the queen, though he remains a member of the Vadalis family. His brother is the patriarch of the house, Dalin d'Vadalis (CG male human expert 8), and the two remain close despite Sasik's change in station.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} is the only human house to have its center of power outside the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Its members have no titles, not even the patriarch. Vadalis makes no claim to nobility or greatness, a fact that aggravates the more ambitious houses. Outside the house, guild members who have attained excellence in their fields are known as breedmasters, but this title is designed solely to inspire confidence in those who have business dealings with the house. No set council advises the patriarch; rather, decisions are a family affair, with all adults present in the enclave giving their opinions on important matters. These meetings can be long and chaotic, but members of Vadalis consider them integral to the function of the house. Patriarchs who ignore the will of others quickly find themselves replaced.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} go their own way, not caring what others think, and this willfulness feeds into the antipathy some have toward the house. Though few common folk are foolish enough to subscribe to the tales of Vadalis as a breeder of monsters, members of the house typically cannot be bothered to deny those tales. As a result, the people of rural Khorvaire are friendly toward Vadalis heirs if they have worked with them, but unfriendly if they haven't. City folk are typically indifferent, but a Vadalis heir in the city might be met with thinly veiled contempt.</p>\n<p>Members of most dragonmarked houses have an initial reaction of indifferent upon meeting a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis}, given the difference in approach and style between Vadalis and the other houses. The exception to this is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House OrienOrien]{House Vadalis}, whose members are uniformly friendly toward Vadalis heirs. Members of the Wardens of the Wood also have an initial attitude of friendly toward members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis}, while most other druidic sects have an initial attitude of indifferent. The exception is the Ashbound, whose abhorrence for magebred animals makes them hostile toward the house.</p>\n<h2>House Vadalis's HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} had its home in the western wilds of Aundair long before Galifar came to pass. When the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} withdrew from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, the house saw little reason to leave.</p>\n<p>The small city of Varna acts as the seat of Vadalis power. Most of its people work in some way for the income generated by Vadalis trade, but the house uses its enclave within the city primarily as a place to conduct business with the outside world. The majority of its research and bloodline development takes place at Foalswood, the sprawling ranch that the Vadalis family calls home.</p>\n<p>A far cry from the defensible keeps maintained by other houses, Foalswood is a complex of barns, warehouses, and homes nestled among the rolling hills around Varna. Though one of the smallest house headquarters by population, Foalswood features uncountable acres of pasture and meadow where Vadalis animals roam. Though he spends his days in Varna, the patriarch lives at Foalswood, as do most of the heirs to the house. The largest building designed for human use is the ranch's great meeting house.</p>\n<p>Outside Varna, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} maintains enclaves in small towns across the Reaches, including Merylsward, Delethorn, and Erlaskar. It has a large ranch outside the village of Shavalant and another on the outskirts of Wroat. The house also has holdings in the cities of Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, Stormreach, and Trolanport.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} makes an excellent addition to a wilderness or rural campaign, or even a low-powered game where a traditional dragonmarked house would prove disruptive. Because Vadalis thrives away from the cities, it can show up in places where the other houses would not normally be found. Given its base in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, House Vadalis also provides a connection for shifter characters, allowing them to more easily fit into a game involving the machinations and plots of the dragon marked houses.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Vadalis]{Organizations in House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis as an Organization]{House Vadalis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{People of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis in the World]{House Vadalis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Vadalis]{Playing a Member of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Family Business]{Family Business}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-vadalis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_aox13eajy0c","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"PQp5TN73aCIohDt9","name":"Principles of Arcane Science","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Principles of Arcane Science</h1>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they're fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<h2>SIBERYAN THEORY</h2>\n<p>Siberyan theory is the dominant arcane tradition of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. This asserts that arcane magic taps energies that flow from the Ring of Siberys. This power—sometimes called the blood of Siberys—is the same fundamental force the Progenitors used to shape reality; arcane magic essentially reshapes reality to produce the desired result. Certainly, the blood of Siberys can be used to create a fireball; once upon a time, that same power was used to create <em><strong>the Sun</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Siberyan magic is in some ways the most scientific approach to magic, and can in a sense be seen as analogous to programming; the wizard is rewriting the code that defines reality. Its invocations are words of power that activate specific energies—fire, vast, distance—while its gestures shape and focus those energies. But ultimately, the forces flow through the spellcaster and it is a mental exertion—both intense calculations and an exertion of will—that generates the change. This explains the various limitations of a wizard. A wizard can look at a spellbook and understand the theory behind a more powerful spell or one they do not know. They can gather the right materials, make the appropriate gestures, say the right words. But if they don't have enough experience and talent, they can't perform the mental work required; they understand the concept but they can't do the work required to produce the result. Meanwhile, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic]{Casting Modifiers} reflect the mental and physical toll of spellcasting. While there is no other effect—spellcasters don't gain levels of exhaustion from casting spells—the idea is that channeling arcane power takes a toll, and their comes a point where you just don't have it in you to grasp and shape that power. </p>\n<p>Siberyan theory is the most widespread form of magic, used across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and in Aerenal. However, it's a broad field of magic and there are different techniques within it. The wizards of Aerenal and those of Arcanix both use verbal components that invoke the same, fundamental words of power. However, the Aereni techniques are highly formalized and precise—it's a highly effective technique, but it takes decades to master. Since most humans don't have decades, Arcanix helps students develop idiosyncratic techniques—to figure out what resonates with them. This works, but the Aereni find it disturbingly sloppy and haphazard.</p>\n<p>The commonly accepted theory is that arcane energy—”the blood of Siberys”—was part of the Progenitors. According to the primal myths, the Ring of Siberys IS Siberys; this energy is simply the residual primordial power of a cosmic entity. This is supported by the fact that siberys dragonshards are highly effective at focusing arcane energies. Many spellcasting focuses use siberys shards in some way; the crystal is obvious, but a staff may have an embedded dragonshard sliver that helps focus power. However, there is an academic faction that asserts that there is no reason to believe that the Progenitors were cosmic dragons or even immortal. These sages believe that the Ring of Siberys might have predated the Progenitors, and that they could have been a trio of mortal wizards of exceptional skill—wizards who used the same basic principles a modern wizard uses to create a fireball to shape a sun. Those who follow this path generally assert that the Sovereigns were either remarkable mortals or that they were simply immortal entities—like the celestials and fiends—created by the mortal Progenitors as part of their vast work. These scholars believe that this shows the limitless potential of arcane magic—that wizards who unlock its greatest secrets could create new worlds or even shape planes of existence.</p>\n<p>Siberyan verbal components are grounded in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Draconic language}, though there is more to a verbal component than simply speaking in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Draconic }; ultimately it is about the invocation of words of power that aren't used in everyday speech. A wizard doesn't have to understand @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Draconic} to perform magic, but it helps provided deeper insight into the workings of a particular spell.</p>\n<h2>EXTERNALISTS</h2>\n<p>The energy of the planes permeates Eberron, and Externalist wizards shape their spells by drawing on this power. Where a Siberyan harnesses ambient energy and shapes that into fire, an Externalist draws primal fire directly from Fernia. The elements of this magic—the components—are similar to those used in Siberyan magic. Words of power summon specific energies and eldritch gestures help to shape those forces, and ultimately it is the mind of the wizard that weaves these elements together and channels the power. But the Externalist asserts that the most effective source of power isn't the blood of Siberys; it is the energy of the planes.</p>\n<p>Primitive Externalist techniques require a direct connection to the planes. Such magic can only be performed in or near a manifest zone or during a coterminous period. This is an important factor in the overall dominance of Siberyan magic; the people of Sarlona discovering that their spells no longer worked in new lands, and developing new approaches. However, the energies of the planes do permeate the world, albeit to a lesser degree… and more important, creatures are themselves tied to the planes. This is most clearly demonstrated when a mortal creature dreams—passing along its innate connection to Dal Quor—but can also be seen in the conscripts of Shavarath and the shadows of Mabar, echoes of mortals in the planes. So sophisticated Externalist wizards don't require access to manifest zones or gain additional benefits from them (aside from whatever benefit the zone provides to all spellcasters); it's primarily an academic point that the energy is flowing from an extraplanar source.</p>\n<p>Externalist verbal components draw on elements of planar languages; depending on the power being shaped, it could use root syllables from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Primordial}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Celestial}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Abyssal}, or even @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Quori}. As with Siberyan theory and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Draconic}, the spellcaster doesn't have to understand these languages.</p>\n<h2>SYMPATHETIC MAGIC</h2>\n<p>This arcane theory maintains that an effect produced can be magnified; to create a fireball, burn a ball of flammable guano. A secondary aspect is the idea things that have once been in contact maintain a connection—a leaf is still connected to a tree, a lock of hair is still connected to the creature it came from—and magic can flow along this connection. Sympathetic magic still relies on words of power for its verbal components, but its material and somatic components are often quite different from the preceding techniques; rather than tracing sigils in the air, a sympathist wizard might light a match to produce a fire bolt, or plunge a needle into a wax figure to cast crown of madness.</p>\n<p>Sympathetic magic isn't taught at Arcanix. It's generally seen as a primitive form of Siberyan magic—that the wizard is channeling the Siberyan energy, but using the sympathetic focus as an alternative to the more complex Siberyan techniques. This is effective, but not as versatile; it relies on the ability to create a sympathetic construct of the desired result. As a result, sympathetic magic is often found used by self-taught “hedge mages” or clans or tribes that have stumbled onto these techniques in isolation. Again, they are effective, but practitioners may be limited in their range of spells or ability to incorporate new ideas.</p>\n<p>A second form of sympathetic magic is tied to the magical thinking approach to artifice mentioned in Exploring Eberron. Rather than being a different approach to Siberyan magic, magical thinking is actually a form of Externalist magic that draws on the power of Thelanis to temporarily enforce fey logic on reality. The main thing is that this is more often associated with warlocks and sorcerers than with wizards. As a warlock or sorcerer, a character knows a specific trick that always works.</p>\n<p>Verbal components in sympathetic magic vary based on the powers being wielded. A fundamentally Siberyan approach may use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Draconic} syllables, even if the caster has just stumbled upon the sounds that produce effective results. Magical thinking could use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Sylvan} phrases. On the other hand, sympathetic magic can also involve a chant or a poem describing the desired outcome; essentially, it's a longer and less efficient process that combining three syllables of power, but it's something someone can stumble onto even when they don't know those syllables of power.</p>\n<h2>DOMINION THEORY</h2>\n<p>Dominion theory walks the line between arcane and divine magic. It has some broad overlap with Siberyan magic, using word and gesture to channel ambient arcane power. However, it asserts that all magic flows directly from the Sovereigns. It is still approached in a scientific manner; the difference between the Vassal cleric and the Dominion wizard is that the cleric asks the Sovereigns to grant a miracle, while the wizard employs formulas that let them draw on the fires of Onatar's forge or Aureon's law. The Dominion wizard doesn't need faith in the same way that a cleric does, which is why their spells are cast using Intelligence instead of Wisdom. But if they see arcane magic as manipulating the pieces of a great machine, they believe that the Sovereigns ARE that machine, and their verbal components generally invoke one or more of the Sovereigns by name. So they don't REQUIRE faith—but they still have it.</p>\n<p>Dominion theorists can be found in the Five Nations, even in Arcanix. However, this theory is usually dismissed as superstition by both Siberyan mages, who say that Dominion spellcasters are simply drawing on Siberyan power and adding unnecessary ritual. While the Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Five Nations, the standard vassal tradition incorporates the myth of the Progenitors. Siberyan vassals believe that Aureon (or the Shadow) guides those who use magic, but that Aureon isn't actually the SOURCE of magic… That Aureon can show the wizard how to create fire with a spell, but that the fire isn't drawn directly from Onatar's forge. So many wizards are also faithful vassals; Dominion theory is an unusual extreme.</p>\n<h2>OTHER TRADITIONS</h2>\n<p>Siberyan theory is the dominant tradition of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Externalism has significant support and is a respected tradition. Sympathetic and Dominion techniques are fringe techniques, more often found in isolation. But there are many other theories. Here's just a few…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consensualists</strong> say that belief is the source of arcane magic; like Dominion wizards they manipulate that power in a scientific fashion, but they maintain that magic works as it does because people believe in that system—and that it's possible that a paradigm shift in belief could completely change the laws of magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Pact magic</strong> is an offshoot of Externalism, drawing power not from a plane, but rather from a specific entity (such as an archfey or an overlord). Typically this is associated with warlocks, who are granted the ability to cast specific spells; but it's possible that a powerful entity could grant a wizard more general access to their power. Like Dominion wizards, Pact wizards will generally call out the source of their power in their invocations.</li>\n<li><strong>Animists</strong> work with spirits, often fey, elementals, or ghosts; an animist might have a minor fire elemental that manifests when called on in the form of fire bolt or burning hands. However, animists are often sorcerers as opposed to wizards; again, the question is whether the animist with burning hands can swap that out for a new spell, or if they only know a few tricks—whether they are using science, or whether they've just made friends with an elemental.</li>\n<li><strong>Prophets</strong> are one of the most obscure traditions; they maintain that the Draconic Prophecy is essentially the source code of reality, and while they may not be able to see the big picture they can effect immediate changes by effectively rewriting the present. Again, this is a very rare path well suited to the Scribe wizard presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. If a DM introduces this into a campaign, they'll need to decide if this form of magic is despised by the Chamber, who see Prophets as parasites on the Prophecy—or whether, in fact, the Chamber CREATED this style of magic and teaches it to their agents.</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Pyromancers</strong> fall between Dominion Theory and Externalists. They draw their arcane power from the concrete source of the Silver Flame, but this isn't an easy thing to do. The Flame responds more easily to the draw of faith than to scientific manipulation, and Silver Pyromancers generally need both; they manipulate the Flame using scientific principles, but it is still their faith that allows them to grasp the power to begin with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most “respectable” arcane scholars focus on the ultimate source of power—as such, sympathetic magic is generally seen as a Siberyan technique, while magical thinking is Externalist.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_91abiwta8hq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/08.

The party could run headlong into a Medani investigation, become involved with a character being guarded by a member of the Warning Guild, or join forces with a house operative to take on a common foe.</p>\n<p>Beyond the house's role as a counterintelligence agency, Medani (like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Lyrandar}) is looked to for leadership by many Khoravar. However, the house accepts this role as an offshoot of its position as a protector—not as a gods-given right.</p>\n<p>As befits a house proud of its iconoclast status, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} is a tightly knit group. It is among the smallest of the houses in population, and individuals are encouraged to have strong bonds to their extended families. Factional disagreements arise within the house from time to time, but have never threatened to become schism or open conflict. Outside the house, relations between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} are sometimes strained, with the three houses often working on different sides of the same intelligence-gathering operations.</p>\n<p>The relationship between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} is a complex one. Though precious little common ground or competition exists between their mercantile operations, the two half-elf houses have very different views of their racial heritage. Lyrandar had centuries to spread before the appearance of the Mark of Detection, and takes as its mandate the continued development of an inclusive Khoravar race. Even before the appearance of their dragonmarks, the Medani had rejected this view, content to see themselves as heirs to two worlds rather than the builders of one.</p>\n<p>Today, where Lyrandar seeks racial isolation, Medani sees greater strength in being a bridge between two cultures. House Medani's encouragement of occasional intermarriage between half-elf and elf or human is abhorrent to many Lyrandar, who are not afraid to make their feelings known.</p>\n<p>Despite the inherent separation of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild} from the house, strong functional ties bind the members of both. Medani operatives outside the Warning Guild work mostly to collect, collate, and decipher the information gained from the plots the guild uncovers, and both sides look out for the other. In its own way, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani's} store of intelligence might be the equal of either @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, but with one significant difference: Medani's information is never sold. Rather, the house uses the facts, rumors, and speculation at its disposal solely in the service of its clients—and sometimes to convince prospective clients that they need Medani protection.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani's} home and history lies in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, and members of the house can expect an initial reaction of friendly from all Brelish except those who oppose King Boranel's reign. Members of the city guard in the urban centers of Khorvaire give House Medani an indifferent reaction, improving to friendly if they have been helped by (as opposed to shown up by) the house in the past.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement and intelligence agencies recognize @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani's} expertise. At the same time, Medani operatives are often seen as unwelcome meddlers in official business, a view that makes them unpopular in some administrations. In particular, members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} rarely have an initial attitude toward the Medani any more favorable than indifferent.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>In keeping with its role as a house of counterspies, Medani keeps a low profile even in its ancestral home in Wroat. The Medani enclave is a connected network of unmarked buildings within sight of both Brokenblade Castle and Parliament Hall. It is not marked on any map, and those not already aware of its existence would be hard-pressed to pick its well-guarded doors out from among the private apartments and shops that surround it.</p>\n<p>The Tower of Inquisition, Medani's center of interrogation and incarceration, is the only part of the enclave known by name among the other dragonmarked houses. A nondescript stone building overlooking the river, it is said to be as well guarded as Brokenblade Castle itself. Underground passages and permanent dimension doors are said to connect the tower and the castle, created so that the enclave might be used as a secret refuge in the Last War, but this rumor has never been confirmed.</p>\n<p>In addition to its ancestral hold, House Medani maintains enclaves in Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Korth, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, and Trolanport. It has smaller centers in Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, Stormreach, Taer Valaestas, and Varna. Medani outposts can be found in smaller cities across Khorvaire, including Rhukaan Draal in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>When threats arise to the rule of the nobility, the activities of the dragonmarked houses, or the peace of Thronehold, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} is the first to know. Though many among the dragonmarked have reservations about Medani's motives, the house has proven its worth and discretion time and time again. The house's small population but wide-ranging power allows it to function on any social level. Medani operatives are just as likely to be involved in thwarting the plans of the Aurum or the Dreaming Dark as they are preventing extortion attempts against a minor merchant.</p>\n<p>PCs might become involved with Medani through the operations of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild}. High-level antagonists can be exposed by a Medani NPC, thus dragging the PCs (willingly or otherwise) into a storm of intrigue and danger.

Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific reasons, such as:</p>\n<p><strong>Take a chance</strong>. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragoneyes]{Dragoneyes} district is filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls and on street corners. If you you're looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Find refuge</strong>. Though most of the refugees in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.High Walls]{High Walls} come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place regularly. If you're from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.High Walls]{High Walls}, especially if you already have friends or family living there.</p>\n<p><strong>Bond over blood</strong>. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall (District)]{Graywall} district in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Tavick's]{Middle Tavick's} Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith, it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_86zoy3izpgi","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"QswmYY18KFQkuhzH","name":"Dulurrh","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Doluurh</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Realm of the Dead</h2>\n<p>Endless caverns stretch throughout Dolurrh, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward, you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have forgotten themselves. This is Dolurrh. It’s not the embodiment of the idea of death or dying, both of which are reflected in Mabar. Rather, Dolurrh is where mortal souls go after their bodies die, where memories fade and lives are forgotten.</p>\n<p>Mortal spirits are drawn to Dolurrh within moments of death, and their memories begin to decay immediately. Within days, most spirits no longer have any desire to leave Dolurrh, and within weeks, most only have the faintest memories of their previous lives. The faiths of Aerenal and the Blood of Vol assert that Dolurrh is the absolute end of existence, the last echoes of a life before it’s completely gone. But when Dorius Alyre ir’Korran drew his classic planar map (seen at the beginning of this book), he used the Octogram symbol of the Sovereign Host to represent Dolurrh, because he declared it to be the door through which all mortals must pass to join with the Sovereigns. This has come to be a common view: what appears to be memory fading is actually the soul slowly ascending to a higher form of existence, rising to a level of reality no mortal can experience. The Vassals of the Sovereign Host say the faithful finally join the Sovereigns; followers of the Silver Flame say that noble souls strengthen the Flame. What is left is only a husk—the cast-off remnants, like an abandoned snakeskin or the traces of memory that can be read using speak with dead. Thus, while Dolurrh has long been known as the Realm of the Dead, many call it the Gateway. Ultimately, this is a matter of faith—whether the other side of Dolurrh is oblivion or paradise, no one ever returns from it.</p>\n<p>The sage Annolysse of Arcanix declared that Dolurrh must be the thirteenth plane, for it has no opposite. It doesn’t embody an idea so much as it serves a purpose—that of gathering, collecting, and (perhaps) transitioning souls. Mortal actions are judged in Daanvi; by contrast, Dolurrh doesn’t judge and it doesn’t punish. It’s simply the end of the journey—or depending how you look at it, the beginning of a new one.</p>\n<p>All living creatures come to Dolurrh, sooner or later. Those that come here before death are almost always looking for something—a lost soul, a forgotten memory. But living or dead, any who come to Dolurrh can be trapped by its power.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Everything about Dolurrh is gray and gloomy. Even the brightest colors seem faded, the most joyful sounds seem dull. The heavy weight of ennui settles on travelers the moment they arrive, making even the simplest tasks feel challenging. And there’s a constant pull, tugging on memory and emotion, a desire to just sit down and let it all go.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/dolurrh-symbol.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Ennui.</strong> When a creature enters Dolurrh, it immediately gains one level of ennui (described in the “Ennui” sidebar). While in Dolurrh, this level of ennui can’t be removed by rest or by any other means. It’s immediately removed when the creature leaves Dolurrh. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Impeded Magic.</strong> In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Inevitable Entrapment. </strong>Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it gains one level of ennui. Each time it makes this saving throw, the DC increases by 1. Whenever a creature ends a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, it must make this saving throw as if it had just finished a rest, but its roll is made with disadvantage. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeless. </strong>Time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn’t age, and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or drink.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are some ways Dolurrh can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Dolurrh rarely possess all of the plane’s properties; travelers generally aren’t entrapped by ennui simply by passing through one. But these zones are still close to the Realm of the Dead and exceptionally haunted, though not blighted, as Mabaran zones typically are. Shadows move in disturbing ways, and travelers may hear whispers they can’t quite make out.</p>\n<p>The restless spirits of Dolurrh yearn to return to the Material Plane, and it’s easier for them to do so in manifest zones. They might manifest as ghosts, or animate the corpses of people buried in the zone, causing them to return as revenants or zombies. In some Dolurrhi zones, raising the dead can be dangerous; if spells or abilities that raise the dead are used in such a zone, roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table to determine the result.</p>\n<p>Dolurrhi zones can also have positive effects. In many zones, it’s easier to return people from the dead, halving the cost of any material components. In others, anyone can cast speak with dead as a ritual that takes an hour to perform, as long as they have a personal connection to the deceased whose corpse they’re questioning.</p>\n<p>The most dramatic manifest zones are those that serve as gateways to enter the Catacombs of Dolurrh—and hopefully, to return. Opening such a gateway might call for a special ritual or significant sacrifice, perhaps under a particular alignment of the moon Aryth, or when Dolurrh is conterminous.</p>\n<h3>CoterMinous and reMote</h3>\n<p>Dolurrh has a slow planar cycle. Traditionally, once a century, it becomes coterminous for a full year. Fifty years after that, it’s remote for a full year. It can also have shorter phases, tied to the movements of the moon Aryth.</p>\n<p>While Dolurrh is coterminous, it’s easier for ghosts to slip from the Realm of the Dead into the Material Plane, especially around Dolurrhi manifest zones. Any spell or ability that raises the dead can also serve as a conduit for unwanted spirits; roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table when any such spell is cast.</p>\n<p>While Dolurrh is remote, traditional resurrection magic, such as revivify or reincarnate, can’t pull spirits back from Dolurrh. The only way to raise the dead in these times is by traveling to Dolurrh itself and pulling the shade back to the world, as described earlier in this section. Surprisingly, ghosts are also especially common in this time—but these aren’t ghosts that return from Dolurrh. Rather, if Dolurrh is remote when someone dies in the grip of great emotion or with vital unfinished business, their spirit can more easily resist Dolurrh’s pull, remaining on the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Dolurrhi ArtifActs</h3>\n<p>The most common Dolurrhi artifacts are creations of the Smith of Shadows, formed of husksteel, the fused essence of faded souls. Despite the name, husksteel can appear not only as dark metal, but also as slick black leather, dark iridescent cloth, or other substances. Such an object could be crafted from a single spirit—a dagger whose edge is forged from a single moment of pain—or from the emotional residue of multiple husks.</p>\n<p>In creating a husksteel object, consider the memory or emotion that’s the heart of the item. For a magic item, this should reflect its purpose. A husksteel cloak of elvenkind could be formed from a secret. A husksteel variation on a dagger of venom might be formed from a moment of absolute terror; when its power is invoked, it could deal psychic damage and, on a failed Wisdom save, make the target frightened of the wielder.</p>\n<p>Other Dolurrhi items are largely curiosities. The Dolurrhi Trinkets table provides examples.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/dolurrh-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_rljlrhv5eak","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

The Mockery will drag you through mud and blood, drive you to betray your principles and employ tactics that horrify your allies and enemies alike—but at the end of the day, you’ll be standing over the corpse of your foe. Which path will you follow?</p>\n<p>Those who despise the Dark Six condemn the Mockery as a villain, a monster who encourages cruel and treacherous behavior. This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy, using stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean slaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce— anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those who are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.</p>\n<p>Others who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea of honor in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation—all these might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a dark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the techniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause.

Ulara is a scholar first and foremost, and her expertise in ancient plagues proved instrumental in combating an epidemic that ran rampant through northwest Khorvaire a decade ago. But she has less appetite for politics and diplomacy than most of the other leaders of the dragon marked houses, so she prefers to remain among her tomes and grimoires at her Vedykar villa, directing house business through intermediaries and delegates.</li>\n<li><strong>Sahemi the Emissary: </strong>Sahemi was one of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco's} brightest young healers when he was called to tend to the flood of refugees and wounded fleeing what was once Cyre on the Day of Mourning. Dealing with that crisis changed him somehow, and one night he started walking northwest, disappearing into the wilds of southern @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}.\n<p>After a two-year absence, Sahemi returned to tell House Jorasco that the Mark of Healing should be used not just to heal people, but to heal the land as well. Using druidic knowledge he learned in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, Sahemi has started training young members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} in the ways of the druids and shamans there. Eventually, Sahemi wants to find a way to ritually cleanse the Mournland and make it habitable again. He has not yet learned the entire ritual, but every night he gains another piece of the information while he dreams. A charismatic speaker, Sahemi is something of a polarizing figure within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco}. Many of the elders distrust him, but Sahemi's expansive view of what the Mark of Healing is capable of appeals to younger Jorascos.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hanra d'Jorasco:</strong> Hanra rose through the ranks of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Jorasco]{Medics Guild} and was instrumental to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland's} victory at the siege of Orcbone in 989 YK, using the power of her dragon mark to keep the entire garrison in fighting shape throughout months of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} onslaughts. After the war, King Boranel made Hanra an honorary member of his royal guard in recognition of her heroism—and was more than a little surprised when she reported to work the next day in full uniform. Since then, she has become the king's personal physician and one of his trusted diplomatic advisors.</li>\n<li><strong>Ardras d'Jorasco:</strong> He is a healer stationed in a lonely hamlet near the border of the Mournland.

Even after her exile ended, she soon returned to hone her diplomatic talents. Jorlanna negotiated house access to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} through the Wardens of the Wood, allowing Cannith sages to study ruins and magical locales under the druids' supervision.</p>\n<p>Members of Cannith West are expected to be socially adept. In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, they engage in scholarly pursuits, especially those connected to magical sites in western Khorvaire. They have more contact with other dragonmarked houses and local nobility than other Cannith branches do. Jorlanna plans to rebuild the goodwill of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} toward the house and make a greater investment in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{the Twelve}, with hopes of seeing it regain its power. Since the Twelve is headquartered in Korth, it vexes Zorlan that Jorlanna's status within the organization exceeds his.</p>\n<p>Both Zorlan and Merrix remain unaware that Jorlanna's romantic indiscretions are not entirely behind her. For a year now, Jorlanna has been clandestinely involved with a young scion of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}—never realizing that her lover is actually a rakshasa agent of the Lords of Dust. The fiend's immediate goal is to fracture @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} permanently, and he manipulates Jorlanna to that end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

The wind is your ally, the sea your dominion. The Last War shattered @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{Orien} trade routes and devastated @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, but your people are stronger than ever. With the development of the airship, you have risen from the seas to claim the sky.</p>\n<p>Racial identity is an important part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. In a world where nationality and faith often take precedence over race, your family has woven all three together. You have been taught that the Khoravar are a blessed people with a grand future, and that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} lies at the center of this destiny. Humans came from Sarlona, elves from Aerenal. Your kind are the true children of Khorvaire, and the world is yours.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/lyrandar-ship-pilot.webp\" width=\"251\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>For those in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}, the connection to the sea is always strong. </p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>As a Lyrandar heir, you take a creative approach to conflict. Lyrandar swashbucklers love dueling and swordplay, but it is often far more effective to use control weather to sink an opponent's ship rather than face him in personal combat. Battle is never a game, though. You strike decisively, whether you employ magic, a weapon, or clever diplomacy. If you can redirect the hostility of two different foes at each other instead of at you, so much the better.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Whether you were born into Lyrandar or adopted by the house, your rank is determined by your service to the house, service to the guilds, and service to the Khoravar race. Though the swiftest way to earn the respect of the viceroys is by serving as an agent of the house, young Khoravar are often encouraged to wander and learn the ways of the world. Sail the seas, see distant lands, and whenever possible, serve your people in the process. The knowledge you acquire and the contacts you make will serve the house in time.</p>\n<p>Many Lyrandar viceroys are middleaged or older, and the general philosophy of the house is to leave administration to those seasoned by work and the world. You are young, so enjoy your youth. The house will come to you if it has a task to be performed, and your service will be remembered when the time comes.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} engages in any number of schemes. As an heir of the house, you could find yourself mediating talks between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} elves and Karrn soldiers. You might be sent to hunt pirates in the Lhazaar Sea, or to track down an artifact in Xen'drik that might be the key to a superior bound-elemental design. Perhaps you will need to locate, salvage, and destroy a prototype airship lost in the Mournland. Though these are challenging tasks, your dedication to your house could also be tested by darker deeds. A renegade artificer perfecting the means to control an elemental vessel without a dragonmark is a danger to Lyrandar's future. Lyrandar's future is your future, and you know what you must do.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Organizations in House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{People of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]{House Lyrandar as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar in the World]{House Lyrandar in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]{Playing a Member of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]{Legacy of the Firstborn}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8akcoe6m16h","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"TFFgG3l400LWF6Yv","name":"Bloodsail Principality","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Bloodsail Principality</h1>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<p><strong>Prince: </strong>Prince Shaen Tasil<br /><strong>Home Port:</strong> Port Cairn, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Farlnen]{Farlnen}</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ask any pirate in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, and you’ll hear that the Bloodsails got their name from dyeing their sails with the blood of their enemies. This story is a good example of how little people know about the elves—that after thousands of years, they still don’t know that the blood on the sails is that of the elves themselves. The people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Farlnen]{Farlnen} are descended from exiles, elves driven from Aerenal in the wake of the war that destroyed the line of Vol. Although few in number, they are a force to be reckoned with. Even the Cloudreavers know better than to challenge a Bloodsail merchant, and few captains will risk their ships in Death’s Finger Channel unless accompanied by an envoy from Farlnen. Anyone who passes an hour in a tavern in Port Verge will learn that every Bloodsail ship is haunted, the waters around Farlnen are home to zombie krakens and undead serpents, Prince Shaen Tasil is merely a puppet of ancient vampire lords, and the elf merchants are primarily interested in purchasing casks of fresh blood. As wild as these tales are, almost all of them are grounded in reality.</p>\n<h2>Life beyond Death</h2>\n<p>Much as Aerenal has its living Sibling Kings and the Undying Court, Farlnen has a balance between the living and the dead. The Prince of Farlnen is the living ruler of the isle, and she represents her people in dealings with the other Lhazaar princes. But the true power in Farlnen is an alliance of undead lords and ladies known collectively as the Grim. This shadow court watches the living from estates spread across the Fingerbone Mountains. Only the most accomplished individuals can rise to join the Grim. One must display talent and charisma, learning all that life has to offer before passing to the other side. Although these traditions are similar to those of the Undying Court, the members of the Grim are not as tightly unified as the Deathless and do not share any sort of mystical power.</p>\n<p>The lords and ladies of the Grim live in mansions maintained by tithes from the living. Some use their ancient wisdom and mystical power to help their people; others wish to be left to their arcane studies and private pursuits. However, the Grim aren’t the only undead in Farlnen. The members decide who is worthy to join their ranks, but any Bloodsail can earn lesser undead immortality by amassing sufficient wealth. This is the reason the Bloodsails take to the seas as pirates, privateers, or merchants. The price of immortality is paid over time, credited to the accounts of sailors even as it fills the vaults of the Grim.</p>\n<p>When a sailor dies, the funds in his or her account determine that sailor’s final fate. Gifted wizards or clerics can become liches. Wealthy captains sometimes bind their spirits to skeletal sea monsters. Most Bloodsails aspire to become vampires, however, so that they can continue to walk the world after death. The mortal population can sustain only a limited number of vampires, so the cost of this transformation rises with the creation of every new vampire. Because the price to become a vampire is far beyond what any common sailor could hope to acquire, the majority of these elf sailors end up as haunts. Since the necromancers of the Grim can bind ghosts to inanimate objects, they take this task upon themselves and base the outcome of their efforts on how much was in that sailor’s account at his or her death. The more expensive forms of the ritual allow the fallen elf to fully manifest as a ghost, as long as it stays close to its anchoring item. The lesser form keeps the spirit conscious, but allows only limited poltergeist activity.</p>\n<p>The most common manifestation of this form of spirit binding is in the Bloodsail ships. The cheapest form of immortality for a sailor is being bound to a ship—typically to the sail. The oldest sails are infused with the spirits of generations of sailors. These hosts of the fallen can propel the ship with a speed to rival any elemental galleon. They can deflect missiles or tear at enemy vessels, and the enchantments woven into the sails make them virtually immune to conventional harm. The powers of the ghosts depend on their numbers, but these spectral allies make the small Bloodsail fleet exceptionally dangerous. Bloodsail vessels that lack haunt allies often have skeleton crews—small complements of mindless undead that can be assigned to oars or other menial tasks.</p>\n<p>Although existence as a lesser haunt might seem like a bleak fate, the Bloodsails consider it a blessing. Even a lesser haunt escapes the slow dissolution of Dolurrh. He can stay with his ship and crewmates, and continue to explore the ocean. Although the haunt cannot enjoy some of the same pleasures he did when he lived, he is one with the ship and the ship’s other spirits in a way that mortals cannot understand. It’s a limited immortality, but it’s still an escape from death.</p>\n<p>These details give only a taste of the degree to which magic and necromancy affect the lives of the people of Farlnen. The streets are lit with ghost lights. Any family heirloom might hold the spirit of an ancestor, from a chest that opens only for a descendant to a magic blade that whispers to its wielder. Almost all Bloodsail captains are arcane or divine spellcasters, specializing in necromantic rituals. When a Bloodsail captain faces a difficult decision, it’s common for her to retreat to her quarters and consult with the spirits of her predecessors.</p>\n<h2>The Bloodsails and Vol</h2>\n<p>The religion known as the Blood of Vol is a bastardized version of the beliefs of the elves of Farlnen, and it has grown and changed over the centuries. Bloodsail priests are far more pragmatic than are their Karrnathi counterparts. They shape their divine spells from the raw energy of Mabar, and whereas the Seekers of Atur try to unlock the immortal potential of the Divinity Within, the priests of Port Cairn are content with the simpler immortality of undeath. Nonetheless, the two faiths share some common practices, and followers of the Blood are treated with respect in Farlnen. The Bloodsails sold their services to Karrnath during the Last War, and ever since Kaius III turned away from the faith, Karrnath’s shipping and coastline have been the primary targets of Bloodsail raiders.</p>\n<p>Despite these intrigues, the Bloodsails are unaware of the existence of Erandis Vol. The Queen of the Dead needs to conceal her identity from the Aereni Deathguard, and only her most trusted allies know her true name. Instead, the people of Farlnen know her as Lady Illmarrow, one of the most powerful and reclusive members of the Grim. She can use this authority to call on her people for aid or fealty, but she generally prefers to keep a low profile and work through agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Power Groups of the Lhazaar Principalities</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Bloodsail Principality]{Bloodsail Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Cloudreaver Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Coldtide Principality]{Coldtide Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide Principality]{Gray Tide Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Heavenly Fleet]{Heavenly Fleet}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principality of the Diresharks]{Principality of the Diresharks}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Seadragon Principality]{Seadragon Principality}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wind Whisperer Principality]{Wind Whisperer Principality}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_0m345fwgs5kb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"THG0VlSPBuZew6G9","name":"Cyre and the Last War","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Cyre and the Last War</h1>\n<p>Under the reign of King Jarot, Cyre continued to shine. Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre—expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.</p>\n<p>Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}. Cyre’s finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} is a paladin, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} is a fighter, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair} is a wizard, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard—elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything . . . but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.</p>\n<p>Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar’s treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be—and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given.

Skysedge Tower stands near @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Highest Towers]{Highest Towers} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mithral Tower]{Mithral Tower}, and contains upscale businesses just below the park. The park is beautifully landscaped, with gently sloping earth and well-tended grass, small fruit trees, and three small ponds. At the entrance to the park, a 100-foot-tall iron statue stands watch. Called the Iron Guardian, it was crafted centuries ago by the artisans of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}. Legends tell that it is a construct crafted for use in the War of the Mark, but it has not been seen to move in the recorded history of the modern city.</p>\n<h3>The Gatehouse</h3>\n<p>In Carosten Park, near the edge of the plateau, stands a small stone building. Passersby generally assume the building belongs to the park caretakers and pay it no heed, but it is actually a sacred site to the sect of druids known as the Gatekeepers. From this small shrine in the midst of a “natural” site in the City of Towers, the Gate keepers monitor the manifest zone, the sewers and ruins below, and the activity of powerful spellcasters in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} to ensure that no dangerous planar breach appears in the city. They are not overly concerned with ordinary summoning spells and have little worry that the angels of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Syrania]{Syrania} are planning an invasion of the Material Plane, but they are deeply worried about recent events in the Depths.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6i6olmfjt1f","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"W0m33LgNbFm7UaQm","name":"First Tower","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">First Tower</h1>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<p><strong>Thorp</strong><br /><strong>Population:</strong> 288 </p>\n</div>\n<p>At first glance, First Tower doesn't appear to deserve a mention alongside such massive population centers as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Wroat}. If a settlement were judged solely on the number of people it contained, then the place might not even appear on a Brelish map. As the gateway to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} from the northern land passages, however, First Tower earns prominence and notoriety befitting the number of travelers who regularly pass through its humble environs.</p>\n<p>The thorp grew up around a single stone tower, maybe thirty feet high, that legends claim was the first tower built in the greater @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} region. Long before any of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn's} massive structures climbed into the sky, the people of First Tower believe, the stones of their ancient spire were stacked one atop the other. Historians dispute this legend, because the tower and the ramshackle inn that has been built around it are clearly not as old as the ancient goblinoid foundations upon which @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} grew. The people of First Tower nod, smile politely, and leave the scholars to their delusions, for they know in their hearts that they live in an historic and significant location.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the accuracy of the place's history, First Tower serves an important role in the cycle of life around @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. Those traveling to or from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} by land, whether walking, riding, or as passengers in a caravan or lightning rail, have only one route they can take. This route cuts through the crags and cliffs upon which @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} sits, slices north, and passes through the settlement of First Tower. Whether coming from or going to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, if you travel by land you must pass through First Tower.</p>\n<p>All the residents of First Tower earn a living by catering to the travelers moving through the settlement. The inn employs most of them, for travelers need to eat, drink, relax, and have a place to stay while waiting for the next outbound caravan or for their papers to clear so they can enter the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{City of Towers}.</p>\n<p>The lightning rail station, the caravan stables, a general store, and the crown's checkpoint make up the rest of the thorp, as well as a scattering of houses where the locals live. Royal clerks stationed at the checkpoint examine the identification and traveling papers of everyone seeking to travel to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} proper. The checkpoint maintains a small garrison that enforces order in First Tower and keeps the place safe from bandits and marauders who sometimes slip out of the King's Forest.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine—Korran’s Maw—was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.</p>\n<p>And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash’tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash’tar]{Jhorash’tar} could have achieved such a massacre.</p>\n<p>The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable. In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran’s Maw; others say the Jhorash’tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Soldorak} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Droranath]{Droranath} both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned—again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Droranath]{Droranath} blame the Jhorash’tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash’tar]{Jhorash’tar} still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran’s Maw.</p>\n<p>Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below—that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that’s all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash’tar]{Jhorash’tar} after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Ardev was built to take advantage of Chalice Lake, which collects the water of several small creeks flowing across the plains. The town also sits astride a major Orien trade road, making it an important rest stop for caravans traveling to the west. Ardev markets provide the supplies for the king's private dwellings at Castle Arakhain, and the city has more than the usual share of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.King's Citadel]{Citadel} agents to ensure the safety of the king. As the main jumping-off point for prospectors using the old western road to travel to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall Mountains]{Graywalls}, Ardev always has miners in town, as well as those offering maps to “lost mines” and other ancient ruins.</p>\n<h2>Basic Information</h2>\n<p><strong>Origin:</strong> <strong><em>Port.</em></strong> The town established itself on the water where none had done so previously, sprouting worn piers and roads taken by merchants and travelers alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Priority: <em>Military.</em></strong> The town prioritizes defenses and law enforcement.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialty: <em>Farming or Resource Gathering.</em></strong> The town is known for the resource(s) it produces. Base this on what kind of environment and climate the town is in. If farming wouldn't work as well, perhaps they mine or harvest lumber instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Age: <em>Ancient.</em></strong> The town is hundreds of years old, or more.</p>\n<p><strong>Size: <em>Very Large.</em></strong> Up to 2000 standing structures in an area able to support around 8000 people.</p>\n<p><strong>Condition: <em>Moderate.</em></strong> Structures seem sound enough though are, perhaps, not attractive. It is likely that most homes keep occupants dry. Roads are relatively clear, if not clean. The smells are not pleasant, but tolerable.</p>\n<p><strong>Enviroment: <em>Coastal.</em></strong> The town is near a large body of water, such as a lake feed by rivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prosperity: <em>Successful.</em></strong> The town is functional and generates a modest to good amount of coin.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Square: <em>Spacious.</em></strong> Room for lots of vendor stalls.</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Stall Acquisition: <em>Lease.</em></strong> Merchants pay in advance (sometimes far in advance) for the right to a space in the market square.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchant Overflow: <em>Encouraged.</em></strong> Excess vendors are encouraged to set up stalls outside the town, if they are unable to get a spot in the square. There are maintained areas available for use, and provided on a first-come, first-served basis. When in use by vendors, this area is regularly patrolled, if law enforcement personnel can be spared.</p>\n<p><strong>Fortification: <em>Heavily Fortified.</em></strong> The town proper is surrounded by a heavy wall of wood or stone, with several watchtowers built along its length. The gate is double-thickness and reinforced with metal bands. There are additional watchtowers built at various points throughout the surrounding countryside.</p>\n<h2>Community</h2>\n<p><strong>Population Density: <em>Crowded.</em></strong> The town is filled with jostling throngs. Practically all structures are occupied. Some may even camp outside town. Moving about can be difficult, and bumping into other people is typical in higher traffic areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population Overflow: <em>20%.</em></strong> A fifth of the town's population is outside the town proper.</p>\n<p><strong>Farms and Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><em><strong>Farming [Livestock].</strong></em> A group of farms, which provide livestock, are found on the nearest hospitable land under the town's control</li>\n<li><em><strong>Farming [Agriculture].</strong></em> A group of farms, which provide food, are found on the nearest hospitable land under the town's control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Visitor Traffic: <em>Crowds.</em></strong> A noticeable amount of people come through town on a regular basis. Congestion is increased.</p>\n<p><strong>Night Activity: <em>Active.</em></strong> Inns and taverns remain open perpetually. Some shops and services may be open, catering to late travelers or night owls. A fair amount of establishments may still be closed. If the town has a gate, it is kept open, but guarded, ready to be closed, if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition: <em>Friendly.</em></strong> Locals are generally friendly, welcoming, and slow to take offense.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership: <em>Hereditary.</em></strong> A non-elected leader is in power, by virtue of their bloodline.</p>\n<p><strong>Law Enforcement: <em>Strong Town Watch.</em></strong> The watch is run by a seasoned captain with two lieutenants, a few corporals, and an ample quantity of boots on the ground. Presence allows for extra patrols and well-rested guards.</p>\n<p><strong>Population Wealth: <em>Prosperous.</em></strong> The majority have enough to live a good life and, of them, a fair amount can even live comfortably</p>\n<p><strong>Crime: <em>Uncommon.</em></strong> Crime does not occur often but, when it does, it is a noteworthy occurrence.</p>\n<h2>Points of Interest</h2>\n<p><strong>Non-Commercial Locations:</strong> Town hall, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} training facility, gathering hall, archives/library</p>\n<p><strong>Places of Worship: Shrine. </strong>A small shrine dedicated to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arawai]{Arawai}</p>\n<p><strong>Shops:</strong> General store (2), magic shop (books), weaponsmith, armorer, butcher, textile production, carpenter, wainwright, tanner</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>The Naga's Medicament</em></strong> (alchemist) <br /><em>Location:</em> In a market district.

{"_id":"WsFRL3VWSU8kZN1G","name":"Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Why go to Droaam?</h1>\n<p>Droaam is a wild frontier filled with monsters. It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Patrons</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation—even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play—there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll—it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?</p>\n<p>As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.</p>\n<h3>Peculiar Needs</h3>\n<p>There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam—perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.</p>\n<h3>PeeriNg iNto the Past</h3>\n<p>Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.</p>\n<p>The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?</p>\n<h3>Politics</h3>\n<p>Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations—especially Aundair—might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel The Queen of Stone covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>Droaam—and Graywall in particular—is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's is a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.</p>\n<p>A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: What Defines Droaam?]{What Defines Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam]{Political Structure of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Law and Order]{Law and Order}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Religion in Droaam]{Religion in Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?]{Why Go to Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Economy of Droaam]{Economy of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Power Groups}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The most lucrative of these is the prospecting division. In addition to locating @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragonshards]{dragonshards} and other precious resources, the guild undertakes more mundane tasks, such as helping villages find sources of water or helping archaeologists locate relics. The guild has even worked with Riedrans in Xen'drik, finding the crystals that the Riedrans use in their architecture.</p>\n<p>The Finders Guild also dominates the urban inquisitive trade, providing a wide range of investigative services. Its primary competition in this field is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}, but whereas Medani provides counterespionage to wealthy clients, the Finders Guild makes its services available to the common folk.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Finders Guild trains and licenses bounty hunters—both those who hunt fugitives (and who must compete with the Sentinel Marshals of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}) and those who eliminate dangerous monsters.</p>\n<h2>Liondrake's Roar</h2>\n<p>A new branch of the house, the Liondrake's Roar was established to broker the services of monstrous mercenaries from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. The group includes soldiers and laborers, and it is through this service that some of these creatures have become more common in the wider world.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Roar, ogre laborers can be seen hauling goods in many western cities—places where before the war, they would likely have been attacked on sight. A portion of the profits returns to the Daughters of Sora Kell; the hags believe that the Roar will raise @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam's} standing in the eyes of the world.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>Valshar'ak Seal:</strong> The Valshar'ak Seal is a union of dedicated Gatekeepers who have vowed to use the resources of Tharashk to fulfill their ancient duties, and to prevent the Dragon Below from doing the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Cults of the Dragon Below:</strong> The Cults of the Dragon Below have deep roots in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}. Many among the Aashta clan and its allies cling to these old ways. Every sect is different, and many are not actually dangerous—but they can certainly be disturbing to outside observers. Some among them do hope to use the resources of the house to call up the ancient darkness from the world below.</p>\n<p><strong>The Gatekeepers:</strong> Although some Tharashk heirs follow the path of the Dragon Below, others respect the teachings of the Gatekeeper druids. This tradition is especially strong in the Torrn clan; PCs who have ties to the Gatekeepers might receive aid from Torrn heirs.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]{Organizations in House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Tharashk]{People of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk as an Organization]{House Tharashk as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk in the World]{House Tharashk in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Tharashk]{Playing a Member of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Born of Two Bloods]{Born of Two Bloods}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-tharashk-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9utyvuryl06","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Solve mysteries, but remian unknown.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Narathun is a small clan, but has always had power. The mythic hero Narathun was the lone wizard of the exiles, and their people hoarded this knowledge. Narathun was renowned for its magewrights, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies and sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry, secrets have always been one of Narathunhold’s primary exports. Narathun dwarves appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan is known for its artists and its bards; its work is unquestionably beautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans; it’s no accident that its largest city is called Shadowspire.</p>\n<p>In the modern age, the dragonmarked houses and traditions of Galifar have brought magewrights to all holds. But its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of Shadowspire is the one of the finest schools of divination in Khorvaire. Narathun sages have always asserted that no knowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds temples both to the Shadow and to the Blood of Vol. Clan Narathun is fascinated by the Realm Below, though it lacks the forces to push as deeply into Sol Udar as it would like, and Narathun patrons might well employ adventurers willing to risk their lives in the depths. Narathun artificers have embraced the study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for Mordain the Fleshweaver, they have made remarkable developments over the past few decades.</p>\n<p>Narathun dwarves hold long grudges. They have never forgiven Tordannon and Toldorath for thefts that occurred before Bal Dulor, and despise Droranath for a murder that occurred eight centuries ago. Doldarun has long condemned Narathun for its “foul practices,” and its pursuit of fleshcrafting has exacerbated this. However, the other clans value its jewels and its knowledge, and others have always stood in between Narathun and Doldarun. Soldorak and Narathun are staunch allies, reinforced by their interest in the Realm Below.</p>\n<p>A character from Narathun lends itself more to introspection than interaction and bargaining, and Narathun dwarves are more likely to be artificers or wizards than warlocks. Narathun entertainers and bards produce haunting works; the College of Whispers is an appropriate choice. This is also an excellent clan for hermits, acolytes, or clerics tied to the Dark Six or the Blood of Vol. Despite the propaganda spread by Clan Doldarun, Narathun dwarves are no more likely to be evil than any others.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"XrAwOJqf9Ic27okc","name":"The Three Cyres","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Three Cyres</h1>\n<p>When most people say “Cyre,” they’re thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you’re from.</p>\n<h2>Central Cyre</h2>\n<p>If you’re from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the “true” Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?</p>\n<h2>eastern Cyre</h2>\n<p>As an Eastern Cyran, you’re tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don’t accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being “the best of Galifar” or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You’re not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn’t your Cyre that was destroyed—now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you’re unlikely to choose the noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the true royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?</p>\n<h2>southern Cyre</h2>\n<p>Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service—it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you. Many of your friends and family chose to idolize Queen Dannel and central Cyre, believing that she had a vision and would rebuild Galifar, restoring an age of wonders. Did you feel that way? Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_xx0xvw5uv7q","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

When they do, they almost as inevitably seek a healer of House Jorasco. Even in a group that includes a cleric, PCs often come up against diseases, curses, and mortal wounds beyond the ability of low-level healers to remedy. In such situations, Jorasco is always waiting with open arms—and an eye to its purse. Officially, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} never accepts services in kind, but for adventurers who cannot afford to pay, the house will sometimes “loan” the required fee and set an exchange of services as repayment.</p>\n<p>Service to a Jorasco healer might involve retrieving a certain medicinal herb from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, seeking out a beholder's tongue for a rare alchemical cure, or helping to keep anyone from entering or leaving a quarantined village. In many cases, making good on their debt might well place the PCs in need of a healer again.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} was originally a tribe of Talenta halflings renowned for its steadfast nature and healing gifts. With the appearance of the Mark of Healing (and the subsequent appearance of emissaries from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} to explain its significance), the Jorasco halflings accepted that their fate was larger than the plains of their birth. When House Jorasco settled in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} and the lands beyond, the halflings gave up their nomadic ways.</p>\n<p>The legacy of the plains lives on only in the house's leadership structure, which bears little more than a superficial resemblance to the other dragonmarked houses. Groups within the house remain structured along family lines. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{Ulara d'Jorasco} (LG female halfling adept 6/dragonmark heir 5) rules the house as matriarch, but all house members hold the right to advise the leadership as they see fit. The matriarch is chosen by the house membership and directs the activities of the house until she dies or loses the respect and confidence of the house. As a result, Jorasco changes leadership more often than any other house, but such changes have yet to disrupt the house's operations. Ulara spends almost all her time at the Jorasco enclave in Vedykar, and is greatly beloved by her house.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Initial reactions to members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} depend heavily on the finances of the NPC in question. Wealthy individuals have initial friendly attitudes toward house members, while the poor have an unfriendly attitude. Indigent or impoverished NPCs might even have an initial attitude of hostile, especially in areas of plague or war, or if they have been refused help due to their lack of funds.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco's} healing touch can be found across Khorvaire, the house's main seat of power is the city of Vedykar, in Karrnath. The enclave there is known within the house as Resthold, and is the home of the matriarch, Ulara d'Jorasco.</p>\n<p>Within Resthold, one can find the finest healing facilities in all Khorvaire, in addition to a training hospital, a spa for long-term convalescence, and an asylum for those who suffer from madness even magic cannot cure. Desperate individuals have been known to cross Khorvaire to seek help there; it is said that if you cannot be cured in Resthold, then nothing can save you.</p>\n<p>Aside from Vedykar, Jorasco maintains large healing enclaves in Fair haven, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, and Gatherhold in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}. The house also has holdings and Healers Guild facilities in Flamekeep, Korth, Newthrone, Taer Valaestas, Trolanport, Pylas Talaear, and Stormreach, in addition to small offices and clinics across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} fills a specific niche in Eberron, providing an organization whose job is to heal others and taking that game role away from the cleric class. Jorasco is a source of healing that characters can call upon at will, though not without cost. The house can be a great source of contacts and adventure hooks simply because of its high profile in an EBERRON campaign. Because so many make use of it, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} functions as a crossroads for the people of Khorvaire, allowing individuals from disparate backgrounds to cross paths.</p>\n<p>Jorasco NPCs use their skills for the benefit of others, but they can seem distant or lacking in empathy, especially when they press for payment up front. Jorasco NPCs have great respect for their house oath, but do not automatically turn a blind eye to those who cannot afford their services. However, they are more likely to find a way to help a character in need raise the money than they are to break their oath and potentially risk the wrath of the house.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Jorasco]{Organizations in House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{People of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco as an Organization]{House Jorasco as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco in the World]{House Jorasco in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Jorasco]{Playing a Member of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Worlds Apart]{Worlds Apart}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-jorasco-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5h9u5zh9ys4","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

The youngest candidate, he was little more than a baby when the warforged were invented. His age and lack of political expertise give him the weakest claim, but his inheritance of Merrix's legendary skills in research and innovation forces his relatives to take him seriously. He wishes only to pursue his secret experiments in peace, but knowing Jorlanna and Zorlan, he is convinced that a firm hand will be required to keep House Cannith on course—not necessarily his hand, but one of his choosing.</li>\n<li><strong>Jorlanna d'Cannith:</strong> (LN female human wizard 8) is a proud, attractive woman in her fifties. She is far closer to the age of a proper matriarch than Merrix. Her claim is stronger too, as the daughter of Starrin's second wife, Elsabet. Regardless, Jorlanna is considered least likely to attain the title. She has a strong vision for a united house, allies among the Twelve, and the personal magnetism to lead, but the Cannith elders distrust her judgment. In her youth, Jorlanna engaged in a scandalous romance with an heir of House Deneith. Both families put a stop to it once they became aware of the relationship, and the lovers disappeared from public view for over a year. It was rumored that Jorlanna bore a child during her time away—product of a coupling forbidden after the War of the Mark. However, when she finally resumed public life, she did so alone. Today, whispered rumors of her indiscretion haunt her, and critics use them as proof of her lack of judgment where the good of the house is concerned.</li>\n<li><strong>Zorlan d'Cannith:</strong> (NE male human artificer 3/sorcerer 4/dragonmark heir 1) is a distinguished, shrewd scion of the house. His talent with finance and eye for profit made him a trusted advisor to the Gorgon, whose cousin, Xerith, was Zorlan's mother. Zorlan's gifts are countered by a cold, cruel personality that unnerves many within the house. His time in Karrnath is rumored to have drawn him into the customs of that land, including worship of the Blood of Vol. Some fear that Zorlan's ambition could lead him to make pacts with dishonorable groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

As a result, adventurers are more likely to encounter the house when they need its services, not because they have been caught up in its schemes. At the same time, the gnomes are driven by a thirst for knowledge, a desire for order, and their own maze of internal intrigues—any of which could draw @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} into an adventure.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} was instrumental in standardizing the system of viceroys, ministers, and seneschals that forms the backbone of dragonmarked hierarchy. Beneath this, the house employs a dizzying array of titles and offices that are largely cosmetic in nature. When two viceroys meet, the Bearer of the Thirteenth Word has a slight social advantage over the Bearer of the Fourteenth Word, but both are still viceroys. Some of these honors can be granted or transferred by a viceroy, some require the intervention of the matriarch, and some are based entirely on social custom. For example, any heir who invents a new idiom is entitled to the honorific “Wordsmith.”</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} is composed of twelve families, including the Torralyns, Severins, Lyrrimans, Syrralans, Corralyns, and Santors. Political games can be found at all levels of the house, and even a house matriarch can be replaced if a sufficient number of viceroys stand against her. The stability of the house takes precedence over personal ambition, though, and the current matriarch, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{Doyenne Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis} (N female gnome, bard 6/dragonmark heir 4), has held her post ably for some ninety years.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Speakers Guild and the Notaries Guild, a number of other important agencies operate within the house. Oversight is the security arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}, and defends the house's reputation for absolute confidentiality and impartiality. Oversight protects Sivis from spies and scrying eyes, but also polices the house membership, swiftly punishing those who threaten the stability of the organization. In addition to its own highly skilled operatives, Oversight often works with operatives of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thuraani}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, and the Trust, creating the tightest web of secrecy that gold can buy. As with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and the Trust, Oversight is allowed a great deal of latitude in its methods: Gnomes who leak house secrets have a tendency to simply disappear.</p>\n<p>The Hidden Word is a division of the Notaries Guild that develops codes and code-breaking techniques, in addition to its work concealing information by magical means. It did a brisk business during the Last War.</p>\n<p>Tasker's Dream is a think tank. Though Tasker Torralyn d'Sivis worked within the Twelve when he invented the speaking stone, Tasker's Dream is a private arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} dedicated to the development of new forms of magical and linguistic communication. Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} remains a vital member of the Twelve, its current inhouse projects include dragonshard focus items designed to enhance the sending ability of the greater Mark of Scribing, and exploration of the potential of telepathy.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>The strict neutrality of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} means that it has few enemies; as such, most people have an indifferent reaction toward Sivis gnomes. House Kundarak is a notable exception. Because of the close ties between the Sivis scribes and the Kundarak banking empire, the Kundarak dwarves typically have a friendly attitude toward Sivis heirs.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis'} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The oldest Sivis enclave is located in the city of Korranberg in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, and this remains the heart of the house in the present day. The regional viceroys coordinate efforts from enclaves in the capital cities of every nation of Khorvaire, including @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}. Though Sivis enclaves are designed to facilitate interaction with people of all races, the inner heart of an enclave is constructed for Small humanoids. As such, members of larger races find it difficult to infiltrate a Sivis citadel. Secrecy is of paramount importance to members of the house, and Oversight uses abjuration magic to shield critical areas from prying (or scrying) eyes.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Sivis heirs are typically polite, well spoken, and firmly committed to the neutrality of their house. Even when he has an agenda, a Sivis heir is more likely to direct actions subtly—making suggestions but allowing others to take the credit and glory when they act upon those suggestions.</p>\n<p>Though the house is unlikely to ever be front and center in an adventure, Sivis NPCs might be revealed as the instigators of that adventure when all is said and done. Sivis PCs can forge ties to the house in many ways. Tasker's Dream could serve as a patron for a party that contains an arcanist or psionic Sivis heir. Alternatively, the PCs might stumble into coded information not meant for them, then find themselves deputized by the Hidden Word agents pursuing it.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Organizations in House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{People of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis as an Organization]{House Sivis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis in the World]{House Sivis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Sivis]{Playing a Member of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Impartial Voice]{The Impartial Voice}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-sivis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_k6d9algq2g","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

It pioneered the marriage of magic to the needs of daily life, and members of the house are the foremost experts on the use of dragonshards. Along with the gnomes of Zilargo, the house created the elemental ships that cross the seas. In partnership with House Orien, it forged the lightning rail that once spanned Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Cannith's most indelible mark on history was made in 965 YK with the creation of the warforged. The mastermind behind the warforged was Merrix d'Cannith, who set out to create a sentient construct that could fight in place of living creatures. First commissioned by King Jarot, the last king of Galifar, the warforged instead went to battle on behalf of his children during the Last War.</p>\n<p>Merrix's son Aarren gave sentience to these living constructs. For thirty years, the sale of warforged kept Cannith prosperous, with each of the Five Nations commissioning troops from Whitehearth, Cannith's ancestral forgehold. The house seemed destined to prosper as the Last War dragged on. Then came the Day of Mourning.</p>\n<h2>PARADISE LOST</h2>\n<p>On the Day of Mourning, a blast of arcane power obliterated Cyre, leaving empty wasteland. Most Cyrans perished that day, including the patriarch of House Cannith: Baron Starrin d'Cannith, known as “the Gorgon” for both his intimidating manner and the symbol of his house.</p>\n<p>What caused the Day of Mourning, none can say. It seems that of the cities of Cyre, Eston suffered the greatest damage. Whitehearth's destruction claimed the life of not only the baron, but also many of the house's prominent leaders and dragonmarked heirs.</p>\n<p>Almost as great as the loss in blood was the loss of the forgehold itself. Whitehearth had been the center of Cannith ingenuity and invention for centuries. Only projects concurrently researched in Sharn by Merrix d'Cannith, grandson of the first Merrix, survived. Whitehearth is never far from the minds of House Cannith's leaders, with Merrix in particular striving for its recovery. Increasingly, though, the cost associated with that recovery effort has exacerbated the rift within the house. Some seek to resurrect Whitehearth one day; others wish to turn their backs on the tomb of the past and focus instead on the future.</p>\n<h2>THE TREATY OF THRONEHOLD</h2>\n<p>Two years after the loss of Cyre, the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, putting an end to both the war and the nation of Galifar. No one profits during war like a weaponsmith, and no one suffers as much from war's end.</p>\n<p>For House Cannith, the treaty brought more than the end of a profitable market: The signatory nations recognized the warforged as a free people, due the same rights as other sentient races. The treaty also forbade Cannith from creating more warforged, ensuring that the house's crowning achievement would be remembered as little more than a bloody postscript to past glory.</p>\n<p>Having no choice but to agree to the treaty's terms, the heads of the fractured house returned to their respective homes, plotting in silence while they went through the motions of retooling House Cannith for peace. Merrix, however, never intended to let his grandfather's legacy pass away. His stronghold in Sharn holds a secret creation forge, known only to the sworn heirs of his line.</p>\n<p>Today, those who gain entry to the Sharn forgehold see significantly newer warforged. Unaware of their rights as sentient beings, these warforged serve the artificers, who seek the next evolution of design. This secret rebellion leads Cannith along a dangerous path. Should Merrix's deception be discovered, Breland and the other nations will have to enforce the treaty—even if it means striking the blow that shatters House Cannith for all time.</p>\n<h2>The Three-Headed GORGON</h2>\n<p>When Starrin d'Cannith died, he left no direct heir or immediate relations, but it did not take long for claimants to the house leadership to appear. Typically, upon the death of the patriarch, the title goes to either his closest living relative or his named successor. Starrin's named successor was his only son Norran, who died with his father in Cyre and left no children of his own.</p>\n<p>When succession becomes murky, the elders of the house interpret the will of the former patriarch and choose a successor. However, with the ranks of the house leadership decimated, no effective or fair vote could be held. Cannith was paralyzed, with three heirs emerging to claim leadership: Merrix d'Cannith, Jorlanna d'Cannith, and Zorlan d'Cannith. Though each had a valid claim to the patriarch's seat, a more problematic set of candidates would be hard to find.</p>\n<p>Merrix, Jorlanna, and Zorlan are each determined to become the next leader of House Cannith. Between them, they have divided the lords seneschal so evenly that a new patriarch will likely never be chosen. As it stands, the divided leadership makes it increasingly likely that only death or disaster will change the balance of power.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

House heirs and half-elf adventurers might find</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} to be a valuable patron, but those who cross it find that the kraken is a deadly foe. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} uses the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses. The house leader holds the title of matriarch or patriarch, but is often addressed as \"firstborn\" by members of the house who believe that Lyran and Selavash speak through her. The current matriarch is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{Esravash d'Lyrandar}, one of the youngest matriarchs in the house's history.</p>\n<p>In addition to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Raincallers Guild} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} controls a number of smaller agencies and cabals. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Sela's Path} is the priesthood of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Lyran's Gift} is the arcane research arm of the house working with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{the Twelve}, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Storm Front} is rumored to be a cult operating within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arawai]{Arawai} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Kol Korran]{Kol Korran} but the mark of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Devourer]{the Devourer}.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} has long championed the Khoravar race, and Lyrandar heirs receive a friendly reaction in many half-elf communities. At the same time, those half-elves who prefer to maintain strong ties to humans and elves (an attitude common in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}) see arrogance in the Lyrandar, and can be unfriendly or even hostile to their cousins. Lyrandar heirs face an unfriendly reaction from the people of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities}, but a friendly welcome in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}.</p>\n<p>Lyrandar does its best to spread its dealings across the dragonmarked houses, hiring protection from both @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Tharashk}, while using both @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thuranni} for intelligence and covert services. Its relationship with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} is sometimes strained, but tensions with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} run high. Orien suffered during the Last War, and the airship poses a serious threat to their monopoly on overland transportation. Orien heirs are typically unfriendly toward Lyrandar heirs, but real conflict seldom arises between them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The matriarch of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} has her seat in Stormhome, an island off the northern coast of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Lyrandar mages transformed this once-desolate island into a paradise, and it is now home to a number of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Ghallanda} resorts in addition to the Lyrandar enclave. An Aundairian garrison stationed on Stormhome protects the entrance to Scion's Sound, but the island is informally considered House Lyrandar's territory. It has long been a hotbed of intrigue. Beyond Stormhome, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} has enclaves in most major port cities of Khorvaire, in addition to land in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} that it holds in violation of the Korth Edicts. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar} elves have little interest in fallen Galifar's laws, and this suits Lyrandar well.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Airships are often an adventurer's definitive mode of transportation, and a colorful contact in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} can add flavor to any campaign. The house can be a generous patron to half-elf adventurers, and it might be interested in adopting a half-elf (dragonmarked or otherwise) with the right skills. Adventurers could be called upon by the house to test prototype airships, accompany missions of exploration, or take part in clandestine efforts to transform Valenar politically, creating a Khoravar nation under the very eyes of the warrior elves.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Lyrandar's ruthless nature and ambition make the house a compelling foe. Dark rumors tell how the house engages in extortion, weather manipulation, blackmail, piracy, and murder to accomplish its goals. Even if the matriarch does not support such strongarm tactics, the sinister {House Lyrandar} cult has supporters throughout the house, and it might do so without her knowledge.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Organizations in House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{People of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]{House Lyrandar as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar in the World]{House Lyrandar in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]{Playing a Member of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]{Legacy of the Firstborn}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8akcoe6m16h","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"ZPC6JZu5rtwvYP5V","name":"Graywall: The Shape of Graywall","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Shape of Graywall</h1>\n<p>Ten thousand years ago, the Dhakaani goblins built a fortress to defend the valley between the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] Mountains and the Byeshk Mountains. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] was a land of monsters even then, and while the Dhakaani built a number of cities past the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall], they wanted to be sure they could hold the gate. During the Xoriat Incursion, the fortress of Korash Khaar stood strong for years of battle. Then the daelkyr took to the field of battle. Dyrrn the Corruptor came to Korash Khaar, and the fortress fell before him. Some say the fortress walls absorbed the guardians, and that this accounts for the blood-red coloring of the remaining stones. Whatever the truth of the matter, Korash Khaar was no more, and the pass was abandoned.</p>\n<p>Over the course of millennia, many different groups took shelter in the ruins of Korash Khaar. Savage goblins fought over the bloodstained stones. The goblins were driven out by gnolls, who in turn lost the land to ogres and oni during the Borunan Exodus. The ogres abandoned it, and the tales of this time speak of ruddy gargoyles emerging from the stone and a darkness rising from beneath the town. Following this, the haunted ruins were shunned . . . until the coming of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The tales say that it was Sora Teraza who found Xorchylic, who had been bound beneath Korash Khaar thousands of years earlier. The project was entrusted to the mind flayer, and he was given an army with which to work. A number of the old goblin buildings were restored, while others were stripped for their stone and rebuilt. Quarries were quickly established, and ogres hauled great blocks of stone to feed the appetite of the growing town.</p>\n<h2>Architecture and Appearance</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is a town built with the strength of ogres, designed by the shared vision of Xorchylic and the medusa masons of Cazhaak Draal. Most buildings are functional structures of bare granite. But as one walks past the plain stone, it appears to ripple and flow in peripheral vision—the result of strange textures designed by Xorchylic. This subliminal patterning produces a noticeable emotional response in sentient beings. A traveler finds that she feels a slight touch of dread when she steps into an alley, while the open square feels pleasant and peaceful. Locations are identified by simple, iconic images; many of the inhabitants of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] cannot read, and only the basic icons work for the more dimwitted residents.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is built atop a network of tunnels, and many buildings have at least one level that lies underground. Some of these subterranean passages connect all the way to the region known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{Khyras}, but these passages are typically warded or blocked off; nonetheless, a group of adventurers might find a hidden passage to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{Deep Door}, or break into a building by coming up from Khyras.</p>\n<p>Most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is designed to accommodate monsters of all shapes and sizes. The arch of a doorway is large enough for a troll to step through without squeezing. Some buildings have a second door for goblins or kobolds; others place a hatch in the main door, with a leather curtain draped down to keep out the weather. Any sort of public room includes stools and chairs in a variety of sizes, as well as skins along the floor for larger creatures to sit upon. Public buildings are likely to have high ceilings and a few perches set up along the walls—posts for harpies and gargoyles.</p>\n<h2>Districts</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] is divided into four districts, along with two areas that are not part of the town but might play a role in adventures. The names include both the Goblin name and the Common translation; the first name is the one most commonly used.</p>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/droaam/medusa-in-droaam.webp\" /></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

One popular form of bounty battle is Six Stones, in which seven challengers are set in the arena with one or more basilisks; the combatants are not allowed to fight the basilisks or kill one another, and the contest continues until only one contestant remains. PCs who wish to fight in the arena can seek a sponsor who can get them into the ring for a share of the purse. The two likely sponsors are <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Kel’Ashta</em></span>, a Tharashk orc who monitors the arena for possible mercenary recruits; and <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Fela Fingerbones</em></span>, a clever goblin rogue whose family has been spreading its roots into gambling activities across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Tooth: </strong>The Blood Tooth is a rough tavern; any disputes between patrons can be settled quickly in the challenge ring in the common room. The Bloody Tooth caters primarily to monstrous clientele, and humans and their ilk receive a cold welcome here.</p>\n<p><strong>The Broken Sword: </strong>A tavern catering to ex-soldiers of the eastern nations, the Broken Sword has Knights Arcane to Darguul chainmasters within it at any given moment. Located in Bloodstone, this tavern counts war criminals, brigands, and revolutionaries among its clients. A Cyran warforged named <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Maul</em></span> serves as both bartender and bouncer; either he owns the tavern, or the true owner has chosen to remain anonymous. Patrons of the Broken Sword are expected to leave their national feuds outside. Within the Broken Sword, the Thrane paladin and Karrnathi bone knight are both exiles. The unwritten rule is that if anyone starts a fight in the Sword—especially a Sentinel Marshal or other bounty hunter—every patron lends a hand, acting to end the fight as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rings: </strong>The arena is the sight of grand battles, but no shortage of conflict exists throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}. Circles are scratched into the ground at many of the major intersections in Bloodstone. Most contain large chunks of stone, shards of broken statues, or patches of dried blood. A wide variety of challenges take place in these rings. Brawling and feats of strength are commonplace. Minotaurs engage in a form of wrestling in which the two combatants seek to push or shove the opponent out of the ring. Most of these are skill challenges involving @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, but there are alternatives. A kobold duel is a match of insults and put-downs judged by the onlookers; such a challenge could use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Taunt]{Taunt} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} to determine success.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/droaam/pit-fight.webp\" /></div>\n<p><strong>The House of Worms: </strong>An injured gladiator who can’t afford the services of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} can try his luck at the House of Worms in Bloodstone. The grizzled and ornery longtooth shifter who runs the hostel is known as <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Worms</em></span>, due to his use of broodworms in treating infected wounds. Although his techniques are disturbing, Worms has a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing} at a d10. Usually Worms can provide only mundane treatment, but he’s always on the lookout for ritual scrolls, and at any given time he might assist with a ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hydra Halls: </strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} is a young town that was built to house thousands. The Hydra Halls are mass dormitories, and each is virtually identical in layout and appearance to the others. The only distinctive feature of a hall is the unique icon painted above the main entrance. As such, an ogre knows that he lives in the Eye or the Claw. Most of the halls are assigned to specific work crews, but a few have rooms available for monstrous travelers on a barter basis. The halls are spread around the two enormous grist mills, where the laborers go for food, drink, and harpy song.</p>\n<p><strong>Jabra’s: </strong>A distant relative of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}, the night hag <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Jabra</em></span> is an alchemist of remarkable skill. In addition to selling traditional potions, she produces dragon’s blood, blood gin, and other unusual and possibly dangerous elixirs. She also bottles dreams and nightmares, and for a sufficient price she could acquire the dreams of a specific individual for the PCs. Jabra’s storefront is a simple tent, and she moves around Bloodstone on a daily basis, sometimes disappearing for days or weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>The Labyrinth: </strong>Built at the base of an old quarry, the Labyrinth is a literal hole in the ground. Its rooms are scattered throughout a maze of passages, making it the perfect home away from home for the fugitive who doesn’t want to be found. A family of minotaurs owns the bar, and they take the privacy of their guests seriously. <br /><span style=\"color:#ba372a\"><strong>Cost: </strong></span>The average cost of a room is 2 gp per night, with a 10% discount for long-term rental. The price is high given the austere nature of the accommodations, but the Labyrinth caters to fugitives who have gold and need privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Skin Factory: </strong>Although laborers can eat a meal at a grist factory, no one likes grist. The Skin Factory is the name given to the collection of slaughterhouses, butchers, and tanners found on the edge of Bloodstone. The merchants of the Skin Factory are looking for fresh meat, and PCs who bring any kill to the district can get something more useful in trade, whether nuggets of precious metal or preserved rations for the road. The Skin Factory includes <strong>Horac’s Hides</strong>, which is home to a family of orc tanners who make excellent leather and hide armor. Although most of their work is mundane, grandfather <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Gech</em></span> learned tricks from an oni and can produce enchanted armor. A PC who earns the favor of the Horacs might be offered a unique piece designed by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Gech</em></span>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Street of Shadows: </strong>Shrines to demons and various faces of the Dark Six are scattered across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}, but the Street of Shadows is lined with them. From the cairns of the Znir gnolls to the horned idols of the minotaurs, there are dozens of icons and altars. The street ends at the Eye of the Shadow, a small windowless temple formed from black stone. The medusa priestess <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zerasha</em></span> holds court here. A fearsome combatant and skilled ritual caster, <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zerasha</em></span> is the most influential voice in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} after <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Xor'chylic</em></span>; the people of the town have come to trust her oracular gifts. At the moment, she is an ally of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}, but her first loyalty is to the Shadow and to her own warlord, the Queen of Stone. Should there ever be a civil war in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}, the black-scaled medusa will be a force with which to be reckoned.</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth and Steel: </strong>Members of the Flayer Guard are outfitted by the Karda Forge and the goblins of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall}, but there are always customers for arms and armor in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. Staffed largely by shifters and minotaurs, Tooth and Steel produces highly distinctive (albeit mundane) equipment in all sizes. The master of the forge is the oni mage <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Szalas Jal</em></span>, who has focused his mystical studies on the creation of enchanted weaponry. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Szalas</em></span> spends years working on his weapons, and they are tools of great power; he rarely sells these masterpieces, but might make an exception.</p>\n<p><strong>The Venomous Voice: </strong>All the grist mills and most of the taverns of Bloodstone have a harpy songbird in residence, but these are frequently novices honing their skills. The best of these deadly singers reside at the Venomous Voice, a tavern that serves both as a roost for the independent harpies of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} and a place for daring patrons to hear musical duels between harpy virtuosos. Entertainment at the Voice also includes storytelling, choral training (used to teach the youngest harpies the basic skills), and command performances by the most gifted sirens. Many who visit the Voice find themselves braving the dangers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} to return to the harpy tavern, and some jaded tourists travel from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} to hear the legendary performances. The Venomous Voice is managed by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zoryanna</em></span> of the Last Dirge flight, a devotee of the Fury.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"a3lZV667qrjkCXfT","name":"Moons of Eberron","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Moons of Eberron</h1>\n<div><img class=\"centered\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/atmosphere/moons-of-eberron-syberys-ring.webp\" />\n<p>The sky of Eberron is full of wonders. The Ring of Siberys stretches over the equator, its glittering stones standing out even in the light of day. Sages trace images of celestial dragon patterns of the stars. And twelve moons circle the planet, filling the night sky with color and light.</p>\n<p>This multitude of moons affects Eberron in many ways. While Zarantyr has the greatest influence over the tides of Eberron, each moon has its own impact on wind and water, and lunar conjunctions can have dramatic effects that can spawn adventures. A confluence of moons can pull back the waters, revealing ancient ruins along the shores of Xen'drik. Sailors speak of maelstroms that arise when Zarantyr eclipses Aryth—vast whirlpools that can draw a ship into the elemental oceans of Lamannia or the endless frozen sea of Risia. The sage Galeoin, who lived among the Serens, claimed that the moons influenced the tides of magic as well as water and that his barbaric hosts had learned to weave lunar power into their arcane rituals; however, the magi of the Arcane Congress have yet to find any solid evidence supporting Galeoin's claims. A Dungeon Master could certainly decide that a particular ritual, magic item, or <em>eldritch machine </em>can be completed only during a particular conjunction of moons, or that a full moon can enhance the effects of a particular manifest zone.</p>\n<p>Each moon has an \"ascendant phase\" — a 28-day period during which it is unusually bright. To date, scholars have found no natural explanation for this phenomenon, and it remains one of the mysteries of the skies. This cycle of radiance is the basis for the lunar calendar, and each month is named for the moon that is in its ascendant phase. Some stargazers claim that the ascendant moon has a profound impact on the skills and spirit of children born beneath it; a child born in the month of Zarantyr will be wild and mercurial, while a child of Therendor will be gentle and kind. Druids and rangers also believe that the ascendant moon can be a source of strength—that a child of Dravago has a special gift for calming animals when this moon is full in the sky. A Dungeon Master who wants to embrace this idea can provide a character with a single action point on a night when his ascendant moon is full; this can be used only for an action tied to the theme of his moon.</p>\n<p>When the dragonmarks appeared, sages were quick to note the similarities between the powers of the marks and the mythic qualities of the moons. According to popular legend, each dragonmark first manifested during the month of its associated moon. One common belief is that a child born in the month of his mark has a greater chance of developing a powerful dragonmark, and superstitious dragonmarked couples often time pregnancies to end in the appropriate month. As there were once thirteen dragonmarks, some sages believe that there is a thirteenth moon that has either vanished or simply cannot be seen with the naked eye, and the existence of such a moon has been hinted at by dragons and carvings found in ruined Xen'drik. If this moon was once visible in the sky, it vanished long before the rise of human civilization, and the common races do not know its name or place in the heavens.</p>\n<h3>Moons and the Planes</h3>\n<p>there’s a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes—and each moon enters its ascendant phase when its associated plane is coterminous, and becomes unusually dim when the plane is remote. So while unusual, it’s possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a particular time, if multiple coterminous periods converge.</p>\n<p>The connection between the planes and the moons is reinforced by the fact that within a plane, the associated moon is the only one that can be seen in the sky (assuming that any moon can be seen; not all planar layers have a visible sky). However, the phase of the moon doesn’t match its current phase on Eberron. It may be fixed in a single phase—such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full, or it could change from layer to layer.</p>\n<h2>The Twelve Moons</h2>\n<h3>Zarantyr, the Storm Moon</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pearly white<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Storm<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Kythri<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 18 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,250 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 14,300 miles</p>\n<p>Zarantyr is the closest moon to Eberron, and it has the greatest effect on the planet's tides. Superstition holds that there is a far greater chance of being struck by lightning when Zarantyr is full, and that bolts can fall from a clear sky. According to the druids, those born in the month of Zarantyr have a wild and tempestuous nature. Sometimes this translates to aggression, but it can also manifest as pure, unbridled energy; barbarians, fighters, sorcerers, and evokers may all feel a bond with the Storm Moon.</p>\n<h3>Olarune, The Sentinel</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale orange<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Sentinel<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Lamannia<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 24 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 950 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 22,500 miles</p>\n<p>To the naked eye, the orange disk of Olarune seems to have a slight fringe that vaguely resembles the rim of a shield. The druids say that those born when Olarune is ascendant have a strong bond to community and to order, and a natural desire to protect others; superstition holds that more paladins are born in this month than any other. Scattered lycanthropes, especially weretigers, revere Olarune as a sort of demigoddess-protector. Olarune is full every year for the The Hunt honoring Balinor on the 4th of Barrakas.</p>\n<h3>Therendor, The Healer's Moon</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale gray<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Healing<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Syrania<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 48 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,100 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 39,000 miles</p>\n<p>Therendor is the \"brother moon\" of Barrakas, sharing a similar but narrower orbit with the Lantern Moon. Therendor is always full on the 9th of Rhaan for Boldrei's Feast, and eclipses Barrakas four times a year. The Serens and druids maintain that natural medicines concocted when Therendor is full and Barrakas is new are more potent than normal. Those born in the month of Therendor are thought to be gentle and empathetic; priests, mediators, and healers often have Therendor as their ascendant moon. </p>\n<h3>Eyre, the Anvil<strong><br /></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Silver-gray<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Making<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Fernia<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 16 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,200 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 52,000 miles</p>\n<p>When Eyre is full, a keen-eyed observer can pick out on its surface a shadowy shape that vaguely resembles an anvil. According to druidic belief, those born under Eyre inherit a solid, practical nature and a gift for nature crafts. Some smiths will wait until Eyre is full to work on especially difficult projects, and House Cannith enclaves often hold celebrations when the Anvil is full in the sky.</p>\n<h3>Dravago, the Herder's Moon</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale lavender<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Handling<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Risia<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 112 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 2,000 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 77,500 miles</p>\n<p>Large and lavender, Dravago is a striking image in the sky. Its orbit typically keeps it at a distance from other moons, and old legends say that it is herding the rest and keeping them in motion. Children of Dravago are said to be more comfortable with animals and plants than with people—gifted herders, handlers, and farmers, but often awkward in social situations. Some say that stones from Dravago occasionally fall to Eberron, and alchemists have long claimed that this \"purple dust of Dravago\" holds remarkable magical properties.</p>\n<h3>Nymm, the Crown or King Nymm</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale yellow<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Hospitality<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Daanvi<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 28 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 900 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 95,000 miles</p>\n<p>The golden disk of Nymm is most typically associated with royalty. Those born when Nymm is ascendant are said to be sociable and charismatic, gifted orators and con artists. Nymm is the celestial timekeeper: new at the start of every month and full in the middle of it. They people of khorvaire can look up at night, see which phase Nymm is in and almost know the exact date. The halflings of House Ghallanda frequently offer discounted rates at their hostelries on nights when \"King Nymm\" is in its full moon phase.</p>\n<h3>Lharvion, the Eye<strong><br /></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Dull white with black slit<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Detection<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Xoriat<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 27 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,350 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 125,000 miles</p>\n<p>This moon features a 750-mile-long black chasm, and, when viewed from Eberron, the full disk of Lharvion resembles a slitted eye. Many superstitions exist about the baleful influence of this moon, and strange occurrences and calamities seem to happen when the Eye of Lharvion is full in the sky. The druids believe that children of Lharvion possess unnatural insights, and gifted diviners and researchers are often born in this month. It's retrograde orbit and irregular cycles, never quite exactly a month, almost seems to be mocking Nymm. It still manages to come full for Wildnight every year, the night of the 18th of Sypheros when The Fury reaches the height of her power.</p>\n<h3>Barrakas, the Lantern<strong><br /></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale gray<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark:</strong> Finding<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Irian<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 21 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,500 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 144,000 miles</p>\n<p>Barrakas is the brightest of Eberron's moons, and hunters value its light when stalking prey at night. This \"sister moon\" of Therendor shares a similar (if wider) orbit and occasionally seems to hide behind her closer brother. On nights when Therendor eclipses Barrakas—\"when Barrakas is shy\"—sailors worry about getting lost at sea. Barrakas does support it's sibling with an annual eclipse of Sypheros on the 15th of Therendor during the Sun's Blessing to honor Dol Arrah. Those born when Barrakas is ascendant are thought to be gifted hunters, but many also believe they have a knack for clarifying things that others find confusing. The son of Lharvion sees what others cannot see, while the daughter of Barrakas sheds light on that which is already in the open.</p>\n<h3>Rhaan, the Book</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Pale blue<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Scribing<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Thelanis<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 42 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 800 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 168,000 miles</p>\n<p>The smallest of Eberron's moons, Rhaan looks more like a bright star. When viewed with a spyglass, one may see a series of ridges that vaguely resemble scribblings on a page. While Olarune represents the reality of natural cycles, Rhaan tells the story of the year: it comes full for every solstice, equinox, and for the cross-quarter days. The druids say that Rhaan empowers creative thought, and they believe that dancers, musicians, poets, and artists of all stripes draw inspiration from the Book.</p>\n<h3>Sypheros, the Shadow</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Smoky gray<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Shadow<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Mabar<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 56 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,200 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 193,000 miles</p>\n<p>Sypheros is a dim moon, and people often find it difficult to spot in the night sky. Recent observations using powerful spyglasses have confirmed that a jagged crack runs down the center of the moon, as if the moon is splitting in two. Sypheros has a powerful effect on the other moons pulling light to itself, when it is a new moon on the 27th of Vult for the nights of Long Shadows. Many believe that children born in the month of Sypheros inherit a shifty, untrustworthy nature, and parents often seek to time pregnancies to avoid this month. However, the druids say that the children of Sypheros are not evil; rather, they are comfortable with the shadows and can face them without fear.</p>\n<h3>Aryth, the Gateway<strong><br /></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Orange-red<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark:</strong> Passage<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Dolurrh<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 168 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,000 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 221,000 miles</p>\n<p>The black dragon Vvarrak told the first druids that Aryth has a similar effect on manifest zones as Zarantyr has on tides, and that particularly weak manifest zones appear only when Aryth is in its full moon phase. Some say that those born under this moon are restless folk, driven to travel and explore; Lhazaar, who led the first great migration from Sarlona to Khorvaire, is said to have been a child of Aryth.</p>\n<h3>Vult, the Warding Moon</h3>\n<p><strong>Color:</strong> Gray and pockmarked<br /><strong>Associated Dragonmark: </strong>Warding<br /><strong>Associated Plane:</strong> Shavarath<br /><strong>Cycle:</strong> 84 days<br /><strong>Approximate Diameter:</strong> 1,800 miles<br /><strong>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</strong> 252,000 miles</p>\n<p>Vult is the farthest moon from Eberron, and some legends say that it holds back forces that lurk out within the stars. It comes full on the 12th of Nymm for Brightblade celebrating Dol Dorn. The druids say that children of Vult are practical, careful folk who generally plan ahead and prepare for the worst; when disaster strikes, the children of Vult hold civilization together. In his study of the Serens, the sage Galeoin reported that the barbarians believe that Vult \"devours\" the spirits of deceased great wyrms that fail to attain godhood.</p>\n<h2>Lycanthropes and the Moons of Eberron</h2>\n<p>The origin of lycanthropy remains a mystery. All lycanthropes are influenced by the moons, but not all in the same way; this suggests that there may be multiple strains of lycanthropy with different origins. The first strain is only affected by the phases of the moon Olarune; this is typically associated with good-aligned lycanthropes. The second strain of lycanthropy is affected by <em>all </em>of the moons, and multiple full moons can cause extreme behavior; this is the effect reported by the templars during the Lycanthropic Purge, and it encourages aggressive behavior and drives victims to quickly succumb to the curse. The third strain of lycanthrope is affected by the moon(s) that were ascendant at the moment of its birth or at the moment it was afflicted; this is common among natural lycanthropes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":400000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_r97n80kb4w","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/01.

{"_id":"aBVwEZIKYYrPJ4Ou","name":"Morgrave University Faculty","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Morgrave University Faculty</h1>\n<p>“A beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city, illuminating the forgotten secrets of the past.” Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave envisioned his university in this way when it first opened its doors in 738 YK in the city of Sharn. From the beginning, though, the university faced suspicions that it was more a cover for smuggling activities than a bona fide institution of higher education. Lord Morgrave had a reputation as a treasure hunter, and rumors followed of how his fortune had been built on profits made selling artifacts and treasures stolen from archeological digs in Darguun, Xen'drik, and other sites.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the students and faculty of Morgrave University have struggled to help the institution rise above its reputation the way its towers rise above Menthis Plateau. The school has the best library in Breland, a museum filled with unique items from around the globe, and a staff of recognized experts who spend almost half their time in the field rather than behind their desks. Of course, detractors point out that the library is nowhere near the equal of those at Wynarn University and Korranberg, that every year more items are stolen from the museum than are put on display, and that members of the staff are better known as black marketeers than scholars.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that most activities at the university are completely legitimate, and a majority of the students and staff are engaged in honest academic work (though many do so in the hopes of earning a position at a more reputable school). The current Master, Larrian ir'Morgrave, has made a career of public promises to eradicate all illegal and unethical activities done in the university's name. Still, items from the archives are routinely sold to private collectors, and the museum's vaults fill to near overflowing with unopened crates from past university sponsored expeditions while new crates of unspecified “artifacts” arrive nearly every week. Morgrave University, it seems, is a long way from shaking its disreputable past.</p>\n<p>All that said, a number of professors at Morgrave University have well-deserved reputations as scholars and adventurers of renown. Janik Martell, for example, is an expert on Xen'drik's earliest history, best known for his discovery of Mel-Aqat at the eastern end of Xen'drik's great desert Menechtarun. Dala Arand is a young scholar with a distinguished record of expeditions to Xen'drik, including a possible lead on the location of the Scepter of Fell Khadash. Davi Mordath is also young, but particularly distinguished by his research (under the tutelage of Professor Janik Martell) into the serpent cults of Xen'drik. Sana Dhuma, an aged half-orc, is known for her extensive work among the benevolent yuan-ti of Krezent (in the Talenta Plains), as well as a few brief forays into territory held by yuanti in Xen'drik. As the current Master of the university, Larrian ir'Morgrave is no academic slouch, either—he has published more papers on giant pottery than any other scholar, past or present.</p>\n<p>Though in some sense Morgrave University is a single organization, it might be more accurate (at least from a gaming perspective) to describe the many organizations that intersect at Morgrave. Several members of the faculty have connections with the Library of Korranberg, the Wayfinder Foundation, and the Twelve. Beyond these fundamentally collegial associations, some faculty are known or suspected to have ties to the Order of the Emerald Claw, the Aurum, the Dreaming Dark, the Lords of Dust, the Cults of the Dragon Below, and even the Chamber—in short, with just about every organization of any significance in Khorvaire and beyond. All who care about power have an interest in the study of Xen'drik, and nowhere is that interest more focused than at Morgrave.​</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\" style=\"width:98.5269%\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Morgrave University Faculty</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"black-row\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:99.5602%\" colspan=\"3\">Administration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:11.3964%\">Larrian ir'Morgrave</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left;width:73.809%\">The current Master, Larrian ir'Morgrave, has made a career of public promises to eradicate all illegal and unethical activities done in the university's name.

While the mist has not moved any closer since the Mournland came into existence, the presence of the dead nation eats away at the inhabitants of Vathirond. The town has lost more than a quarter of its population to disease, rampaging horrors, or because the people have fled to find safer, less desolate ground elsewhere in the kingdom. Since the death of Cyre and the birth of the Mournland, Vathirond's population has dwindled from more than four thousand to its present level of just over three thousand.

{"_id":"aI9B4LI60yRkXKAX","name":"Droaam: Power Groups","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Power Groups</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} is home to a vast array of creatures. Many of these races maintain isolated enclaves: the medusa city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cazhaak Draal]{Cazhaak Draal}, the harpy flights of the Byeshk Mountains, the scattered minotaur clans, the mysterious changeling city known as Lost. But other creatures have long been commingled. The ogres, ores, trolls, hill giants, goblins, and kobolds of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} have never had distinct cultures; they have always been blended. Although enclaves made up of a single kind of creature do exist, most communities contain a mix of creatures.</p>\n<h2>Warlords of Droaam</h2>\n<p>In bygone days, many of these groups of creatures lived in transient communities, ruled by the most powerful among them and constantly in conflict with neighboring forces. When the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} rose to power, they used force and persuasion to bring an end to this violence. They recognized the most powerful existing warlords as rulers of their domains, and they appointed lieutenants-including oni and other powerful and intelligent creatures-to govern other regions.</p>\n<p>Within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, any creature that commands the loyalty of a band and has successfully claimed and held territory can call itself a warlord, but only a small number of such leaders wield significant power. A few of the most notable warlords and factions are described below.</p>\n<p>Although the rule of the hags is ultimately based on fear, the warlords recognize that the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} are shaping @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} into a powerful nation. As a result, it is rare for a warlord to challenge the hags. However, between the lords themselves, feuds, power struggles, and assassination are a part of dayto-day life.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Cairngorm.</strong> A remarkably intelligent gargoyle, Cairngorm is the lord of Grimstone Keep. He leads the largest host of gargoyles in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and Grimstone is also home to ores and other creatures.</li>\n<li><strong>The Dark Pack. </strong>An alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other bestial creatures is led by an elf werewolf named Zaeurl. The Dark Pack bears a deep hatred for followers of the Silver Flame.</li>\n<li><strong>Drul Kantar. </strong>This oni mage holds the lands around Thrakelorn, ruling a host of orcs, ogres, and goblins. Drul Kantar has neither the power nor the ambition of the oni mage Tzaryan Rrac, and he seems entirely loyal to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}. In fact, he is an agent of the Lords of Dust, and he hopes to corrupt other warlords and convince them to join his cause.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorodan Ashford.</strong> A fire giant exiled from Xen'drik has earned the loyalty of a powerful force of ogres and hill giants. Gorodan knows a great deal about Xen'drik and could prove a valuable resource to adventurers. He arrived in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} twenty-four years ago and quickly established a fiefdom around the only port in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, Vralkek. Gorodan is filled with melancholy over his banishment and constantly complains about the cold climate. He accepts the rule of the hags but generally remains disinterested in events in Khorvaire. He knows a tremendous amount about the giants of Xen'drik, and this information could be invaluable to explorers planning an expedition into the territory of the fire giants, assuming they can find a way to persuade him to share it.</li>\n<li><strong>Harpy Flights.</strong> The harpies have long dwelled in the Byeshk Mountains. The Rotwing, Last Dirge, Carrion Caller, and Storm singer flights have all migrated to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} to serve the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}. </li>\n<li><strong>Kethelrax the Cunning.</strong> The kobold lord Kethelrax has laid claim to Shaarat Kol in the south of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} and leads host of kobolds and goblins-creatures that have been traditionally enslaved and oppressed by the larger and more powerful inhabitants of the region. Though his epithet, \"the Cunning,\" is used mockingly by other warlords, Kethelrax has the favor of Sora Katra and has proven to be clever in his own right. The kobolds are thrilled to have their own territory and are fiercely loyal to the Daughters, but many yearn for revenge against their former masters.</li>\n<li><strong>The Prince of Bones. </strong>A war troll of great age and power, the Prince of Bones rules the land around the ruins of Suthar Draal. He is one of the oldest and most loyal followers of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}, and his cadre of trolls, ogres, and giants is always at the hags' disposal.</li>\n<li><strong>Rhesh Turakbar.</strong> The minotaur warlord Rhesh Turakbar has united the small clans of his people into a deadly force. His fortress is on the eastern edge of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and he often leads raiding parties into Breland in the name of his fiendish patron, the Horned Prince-also known as Rak Tulkhesh (see chapter 6).</li>\n<li><strong>Sheshka, the Queen of Stone. </strong>The medusas have long held the ancient citadel of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cazhaak Draal]{Cazhaak Draal}. Though they are not numerous, their deadly gaze and trained basilisk pets make the medusas a force to be reckoned with. Medusa priests of the Dark Six are spiritual leaders in many Droaamish communities. Queen Sheshka is a skilled warrior and general. She has been loyal to the Daughters, but she is devoted to her people and will always do what's best for them. A male medusa named Carash serves as her ambassador in the the court of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{Great Crag}.</li>\n<li><strong>Tzaryan Rrac.</strong> A cunning oni with a large force of ogres and ores at his disposal, Tzaryan Rrac was quick to embrace the arrival of the hags, but he also yearns for greater power. Rrac is a skilled alchemist and a scholar of arcane lore. As a result of his quick loyalty, the ogre mage now controls a significant territory in southwestern @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, dominating a number of orc tribes with his ogre warriors. While Tzaryan enjoys the order that the three sisters have brought to the chaotic realm, his own hunger for more power gnaws at him. He knows that he does not have the strength to battle the hags directly, but his loyalty could quickly shift if the right opportunity presents itself. In addition to his duties as a warlord, arcane studies fascinate the ogre mage. He is a skilled alchemist and has spent decades studying planar cosmology, arcana, and other esoteric subjects in his quest to become stronger and more influential.</li>\n<li><strong>Venom Lords. </strong>A group of tieflings called the Venom Lords leads a community of warlocks, some of whom are also tieflings. Their domain, called the Venomous Demesne, is hidden away in the desolate marshes south of Blackwater Lake, shrouded by powerful magic. Warlord Bal Molesh is a strong ally of the Daughters, and some of his tiefling kin can be found in the service of Daask.</li>\n<li><strong>Xor'chylic. </strong>A mind flayer serves as the governor of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. It's said that the Daughters found Xor'chylic in Khyber, and received his loyalty in exchange for a pledge that the hags would give him an opportunity for vengeance against one of the daelkyr.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Power Groups</h2>\n<p><strong>The Znir Pact.</strong> Centuries ago, the gnolls of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} set aside the faith of their demon-worshiping kin, abandoning the savagery of Yeenoghu and placing the bond of the pack above all else. Ancient clan leaders created the Znir Pact to bind their people and keep them free of the domination of other warlords—a pact that has held to this day. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} gnolls have never been subjugated, nor have they sought to conquer others. Instead, they serve as mercenary troops and trackers for all warlords, essentially playing the role of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} within the monster kingdom.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk].</strong> Orcs and half-orcs have an easier time in Droaam than humans do, and over the last decade, House Tharashk has formed close ties with the Daughters of Sora Kell. In addition to securing prospecting rights throughout the nation, Tharashk helps the hags by selling the services of Droaam's monstrous mercenaries and laborers throughout Khorvaire. Outsiders who wish to trade with the Daughters of Sora Kell are wise to negotiate through the house.</p>\n<p><strong>The Dark Pack.</strong> The Dark Pack consists of werewolves and worgs. Long hunted by the Church of the Silver Flame, the werewolves of the Pack generally remain in wolf form at all times; many have lived their entire lives as wolves. Virtually all the werewolves in the Pack are natural lycanthropes descended from survivors of the original purge that started more than one hundred sixty years ago. The spread of lycanthropy would reveal the existence of the Pack, so the werewolves take great pains not to leave potentially infected survivors behind after an attack.</p>\n<p>The Pack claims an area in the south of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} as its own and migrates back and forth through this region. It occasionally hunts the goblin inhabitants for sport, although it prefers human prey—especially followers of the Silver Flame. The leader of the Dark Pack, Zaeurl, saw her family killed during one of the last inquisitions and spent one hundred thirty years stalking followers of the Flame before retreating into the Eldeen Reaches to form the Pack. When the hags offered protection from the Silver Flame, Zaeurl became one of their most loyal allies. The three sisters often send the Pack against their enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Mordain the Fleshweaver.</strong> The elven wizard Mordain was banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of the unorthodox and disturbing experiments he conducted. Mordain seeks to master the magic of the daelkyr, the fiendish beings who created the mind flayers and many of the other aberrations that haunt the depths of Khyber. Malformed flesh golems and strange, disfigured creatures—the results of his horrific experiments—patrol the land around his keep, Mordain's Hall. A master transmuter and a deadly foe, Mordain is obsessed with his work and has no interest in the outside world. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} and their followers avoid the lands around Mordain's tower, and he in turn leaves them alone.</p>\n<p><strong>The Harpy Flights.</strong> The Byeshk Mountains have been home to harpies since before the fall of the hobgoblin empire. Six flights remain in the northern mountains. Callain of the Bloody Word leads the strongest of the six, the Wind Howlers. Callain has little respect for the three hags and often seeks to interfere with their plans. If she goes too far, the hags may seek to eradicate this rogue flight. Wild and unpredictable, Callain could help adventurers or seek to mislead or destroy them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: What Defines Droaam?]{What Defines Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam]{Political Structure of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Law and Order]{Law and Order}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Religion in Droaam]{Religion in Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?]{Why Go to Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Economy of Droaam]{Economy of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Power Groups}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"aMAVf6jYEMdjt8fF","name":"Kythri","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Kythri</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Churning Chaos</h2>\n<p>It’s hard to keep a consistent rhythm in Kythri. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even thinking about it, people in Kythri adjust their behavior to avoid repetition. This is the essence of Kythri. On the one hand it’s a vision of chaos, but it’s also about change, adapting to overcome the unexpected, and challenging traditions.</p>\n<p>Kythri is commonly imagined as utterly unstable, with landscapes taking shape only to boil away within moments. And this is true of the heart of the realm, known as the Sea of Chaos. But at the edges of the sea, there are islands that linger. The environments of these Shifting Islands steadily and constantly change; a vast desert might be a lush rainforest in a few hours. But the land itself remains constant, and creatures can live on these islands, adapting to the endlessly changing environment.</p>\n<p>While Kythri constantly changes, its elements are usually natural. A jungle becomes a desert, a blizzard becomes a sandstorm—but it’s comprised of sand, not tiny marble busts of King Boranel. This distinguishes Kythri from Xoriat or Dal Quor; while constantly changing, it’s generally change between plausible options, unlike the unreal environments of the Realm of Madness and the Region of Dreams.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing that’s truly reliable is that nothing’s reliable.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/kythri-symbol.webp\" width=\"266\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Broken Rhythms. </strong>A creature can’t take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it can’t be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.</p>\n<p><strong>Fluid in Form. </strong>When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.</p>\n<p><strong>Embrace the Unknown. </strong>In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes can’t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.</p>\n<p><strong>The Odds Are Odd.</strong> If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hits—such as the Champion fighter’s Improved Critical—its range increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Constant Change. </strong>Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what’s changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physical—your skin, hairstyle, or sex—or mental—you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won’t turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact—for example, if your cleric’s faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that—discuss the possibility with your DM.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Time.</strong> Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are ways that Kythri can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>ManIfest Zones</h3>\n<p>Kythrian manifest zones are often unpredictable in minor ways. Weather patterns may deviate from the surrounding region and change on a moment’s notice. The plane’s universal properties also carry over to many manifest zones. Any Kythrian zone with the Constant Change property might produce monstrosities. A zone with the Fluid in Form property amplifies the effects of transmutation magic and can have dramatic effects on the success of magebreeding; these zones are extraordinarily valuable to House Vadalis.</p>\n<p>Manifest zones can occasionally serve as gateways, allowing creatures from Kythri to slip through into Eberron, intentionally or accidentally. Many monstrosities make their home in the wilds, whereas other creatures—like slaadi—can present very unusual encounters, depending what culture they’re from.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>Kythri’s cycle of coterminous and remote periods is completely unpredictable, lasting anywhere from days to centuries. Curiously, its proximity to Eberron has no discernable effects.</p>\n<h3>Kythrian artifaCts</h3>\n<p>Materials from Kythrian manifest zones are often important components of magic items tied to transmutation or illusion; shiftweave uses fibers of plants harvested in Kythrian zones, and as noted in chapter 4, the manifest zone of Hal’kyth is a vital part of the transmutation industry of the Eternal Dominion. Items that come from Kythri may have unpredictable effects. For example, a hat of disguise from Kythri may function normally when its wearer keeps in mind exactly what they want to look like; but if they don’t consciously enforce an appearance, it slowly but continuously changes minor elements of their disguise.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/kythri-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_5gpkequgfaj","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

The Purple Jewel of Galifar’s Crown, the most beautiful and artistically advanced of the Five Nations, ceased to exist on the Day of Mourning. Four years ago, without warning and without explanation, foul gray mists swept out from the nation’s center, leaving behind a broken, twisted land of horrors. That the fear inspired by the Mourning led, eventually, to the Treaty of Thronehold and the end of the Last War is of little solace to Cyre’s survivors, who struggle today to make their way through a world that fears and distrusts them.</p>\n<p>Cyre was twice the victim of the Last War. King Jarot’s daughter Mishann should have, by all rights and traditions, assumed the throne, but she was prevented from doing so by her ambitious siblings. For a hundred years, Cyrans viewed the Last War as a personal affront, a war against them as a nation. Losing both Cyre and Queen Dannel to the Mourning was a doubly heavy blow, and survivors still harbor grudges against all the other Five Nations.</p>\n<p>During its heyday, Cyre was a land of plenty, with lush farmlands, thriving cities, traditions of art, and elegant styles. As the primary battleground of much of the Last War, however, it was dying by inches even before the Day of Mourning. Its outlying settlements were all but razed, and its cities were filled with the hopeless, the homeless, and the destitute.</p>\n<h2>Cryan Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre: Before the Mourning]{Cyre: Before the Mourning}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre and the Last War]{Cyre and the Last War}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyran Style]{Cyran Style}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyran Religion]{Cyran Religion}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Three Cyres]{The Three Cyres}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyran Characters]{Cyran Characters}<span style=\"font-size:15.75px\"><br /></span></h3>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT BRELAND</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>Cyre was the ancestral seat of the dragonmarked House Cannith, the house of Making.

The wealth of the kingdom flowed through Cyre, and it was a nexus for commerce and culture. By tradition, Cyre's Princess Mishann had the rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Cyrans take pride that they alone were in the right in the Last War, but they unquestionably lost more to the war than any other nation. As a Cyran, you stand on the moral high ground, but that may offer little comfort.</p>\n<p>Cyrans like to say that their culture represented the best that Galifar had to offer, which is to say a little bit of everything. Cyrans value diversity and versatility, both in talents and thought. Cyre couldn't match Karrnath in martial discipline or Aundair in the arcane arts, but the flexibility of its forces reflected the nation's ideals. Although the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of Cyre, the Silver Flame had a significant following. Many survivors question their faith in the wake of the Mourning, but some believe that their anguish at the loss of their homeland is a divine trial, prompting them to cling to their faith more than ever.</p>\n<p>Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning and is presumed dead. Her son, Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, holds court in New Cyre, a massive refugee camp set up in Breland. Some refugees support Oargev and the dream of a restored Cyre, while others prefer to focus on the future instead of trying to reclaim the past. As a Cyran, you should decide whether you hold tight to your national identity, or instead consider yourself to be an expatriate without a nation.</p>\n<h2>AFTERMATH OF THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>No nation won the Last War, but Cyre unquestionably lost it. Other nations are recovering from the conflict, but Cyre is gone. The lands not destroyed in the Mourning were lost decades earlier to Darguun and Valenar. Cyrans who survived the war must now carve out a new destiny in the lands of their enemies or in foreign nations beyond what was once the Kingdom of Galifar.</p>\n<p>In creating a Cyran character, first determine how you survived the Mourning. Were you outside Cyre when it occurred, or did you somehow escape the destruction? Where did you take shelter? Breland has taken in refugees and created refugee camps. Thrane also accepted refugees but has worked to disperse and integrate them into the general population. Are you grateful or bitter? Do you have family or friends in refugee camps, or are you a lone survivor? Other Cyrans sought opportunities on the frontiers, settling in the jungles of Q'barra or seeking a new life in the distant land of Xen'drik.</p>\n<p>Many Cyran survivors are soldiers, veterans stationed on the front lines when the Mourning occurred.

{"_id":"amX1sAGQ3bDqvXn2","name":"Dragonshards","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Dragonshards</h1>\n<p>Dragonshards aren't magic items themselves but are crystals imbued with magical energy. They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment.</p>\n<p>The innovations and advancements in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations] would not be possible without the discovery and use of dragon shards. By unlocking the power they contain, artificers, magewrights, and other artisans power magic items, bind elementals into vehicles, create constructs, and build a wide range of fabulous items. When bound to an existing magic item, a properly attuned dragon shard can also augment or improve the item's capabilities.</p>\n<p>Three kinds of dragonshards, named according to their origin, play an important role in the magical economy of Khorvaire—and in the Draconic Prophecy. All dragonshards appear as translucent rock or crystal with swirling veins of color suspended inside. The veins are reminiscent of dragonmarks, and their pulsating makes the stones look almost alive.</p>\n<h3>Eberron dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Eberron dragonshards, also called bloodstones, are found encased in geodelike stone shells—egg-shaped rocks perhaps a foot across. These stone shells usually lie just below the surface of the ground, covered by 2 to 10 feet of dirt and sediment, but always above the bedrock layer. Since Eberron dragonshards are not found buried within rock, most shard fields are in lowlands, as opposed to mountains or rocky barrens. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Q'barra] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]. Many of the most lucrative Eberron dragonshard fields have already been claimed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk].</p>\n<p>In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools-such as the lightning rail and elemental airships-require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Eberron shards are the easiest dragonshards to obtain, at least on the continent of Khorvaire. House Tharashk provides Eberron dragonshards to markets in all major cities of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. The larger cities of the eastern reaches, including Regalport in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities], usually have a few Eberron dragonshards available at a given time, and the cities of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Q'barra] are surprisingly well stocked with bloodstones, most likely due to the rich shard fields scattered throughout that frontier land. Less of a market exists for Eberron shards in western Khorvaire, even though it is the source of most Eberron shard production.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Eberron shards are the most plentiful of the dragonshards, and the smaller shards are so inexpensive as to be commonly found for sale in most towns and cities. The smallest of Eberron shards have a market value of [[/r 1d8]] gp each. Some Eberron shards have a greater affinity for magic, and these greater Eberron dragonshards fetch prices in the neighborhood of [[/r 4d4 * 10]] gp. Eberron Dragonshard dust can be found any most any cost and quanity. </p>\n<h3>Khyber dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding-which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleonsrequires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.</p>\n<p>While Siberys shards are the most rare variety of dragonshard, Khyber shards are the most hazardous to obtain. Nevertheless, prospectors and members of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]{Finders Guild} send expedition after expedition to find the Khyber shards that fuel so much of Khorvaire's industry. Lightning rails and airships have transformed the economy of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, and elemental forges increase the output of many of Khorvaire's smiths and craftsmen. As a result, many organizations pay handsomely for these dragonshards, making the expeditions profitable—provided shard hunters make it back alive.</p>\n<p>Availability: Khyber shards are found only in the depths of Khyber, growing in clusters on cavern walls and floors near pools of magma. The dragonshards reflect the orange-red glow of the molten rock, and the silhouette of a swirling dragonmark is barely visible within the smoky crystal.</p>\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>The entrances into the Khyber depths from which these dragonshards are drawn are spread across Khorvaire, so no single location or region can provide a consistent supply of Khyber shards. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk], through the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]{Finders Guild}, supplies Khyber shards to the major markets of Khorvaire: Sharn, Flamekeep, Fairhaven, Wroat, and Trolanport. While most of this supply is ordered and rationed to specific artisans or Houses based on a carefully regulated priority list, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk] does supply small amounts of Khyber dragonshards to the general markets in those cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>The price of a small Khyber shard varies based on size and quality; a small shard is typically worth [[/r 4d4 * 75]] gp, or an average of 750 gp each. Larger shards, known as greater Khyber shards, are in even greater demand, fetching [[/r 4d4 * 500]] gp, or an average of 5,000 gp each.</p>\n<h3>Siberys dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>\n<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, littering much of equatorial Eberron. Nearly all Siberys shards came from Xen'drik, harvested from the jungles around Stormreach as that city grew. Eventually, the relatively civilized region around the city was picked clean of most dragonshards, and now most shards are primarily found deep within the wilds of Xen'drik. It is believed there are large, massive deposits in Argonnessen but the dangers and lack of diplomatic contacts has stymied collection operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>Siberys shards can be found in quantity only in the Xen'drik trade town of Stormreach and the metropolis of Sharn. Nearly all Siberys shard trade passes through these cities. Other major cities of Khorvaire and Aerenal might occasionally have a limited supply for sale, but the market is anything but steady.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>The majority of Siberys dragonshards fetch [[/r 4d4 * 25]] gp on the open market, an average of 250 gp. About one in ten Siberys dragonshards found after a shower has more complex markings, and can bring [[/r 4d4 * 200]] gp each (2,000 gp on average). One in a hundred Siberys shards is considered a greater Siberys dragonshard, containing much more complex marks. These greater shards can be sold for [[/r 2d4 * 1000]] gp each.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_91abiwta8hq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/08.

{"_id":"bD7rksozmE3scVbo","name":"King's Forest","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">King's Forest</h1>\n<p>A great tropical rain forest fills the southeastern portion of Breland, from the Dagger River in the west to the Trolan River (now part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}) in the east, from the Howling River in the north to the continent's southern coast. The King's Forest is a hunting preserve that once belonged to the Galifar king and now falls under the protection of Breland's crown. The Knight Rangers patrol the rain forest, watching for poachers and trying to keep in check the bandits and brigands who hide within its depths. Since the Treaty of Thronehold, the eastern portion of the forest has been part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}; mindful of this, the Brelish rangers rarely cross the border in pursuit of their duties. Therefore, it isn't unusual for bands of brigands to flee across the border as they try to evade the rangers.</p>\n<p>Once, the King's Forest covered the entire southern half of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, cut in half by the mighty Dagger River. Logging and cultivation have reduced the forest's size over the centuries, and it became necessary for a royal decree to preserve the portion of the forest that remains. All kinds of tropical plants, insects, and wildlife fill the King's Forest. Hunting, except by permit or royal invitation, is strictly prohibited. In the fall season, the king and his court, as well as honored guests, enter the King's Forest to participate in a Great Hunt. Exotic animals of all types are the subjects of the Great Hunt, and King Boranel loves to let his hunting tigers run at the head of his party. Sometimes a dire or horrid animal falls to the hunters (a stuffed horrid ape, killed by King Boranel during the Great Hunt of 966, decorates a hall in Brokenblade Castle), but more often they wind up with a variety of exotic but mundane birds, lizards, and mammals.</p>\n<p>The Jungle Boys, a band of bloodthirsty brigands, hide within the King's Forest. The band is variously estimated to have anywhere from a dozen men to as many as a hundred brigands and a mock court of beggars, harlots, and other hangers-on. An outlaw known as Tree Viper (CE male half-orc, ranger 1/rogue 2) leads the Jungle Boys. The band periodically raids the thorps, villages, and plantations that line the edge of the forest, and sometimes it ambushes caravans and travelers as they move through the forest. The Knight Rangers have tangled with the Jungle Boys on more than one occasion, but they haven't been able to capture their leader or put an end to their marauding.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Sivis was an established house even before the Mark of Scribing appeared among its members. Though the mark originally manifested in only a few of the bloodlines within the house, it has since spread to all the Sivis families. The gnomes are a race touched by magic and driven by curiosity, and the bards and sages of Sivis worked quickly to unlock the mark's full potential. Recognizing the risk of being ostracized for the power they held, the Sivis dragonmarked also sought to make themselves useful to Zil society, even as they distanced themselves from the politics of those they served. In this, they laid the foundation for what would become the standard for the dragonmarked houses: mercantile forces whose neutrality increased their commercial power.</p>\n<p>Within a few centuries, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} spread to other lands, where its heirs' skills as translators and linguists proved invaluable to the young nations of Khorvaire. Many Sivis gnomes claim that their house was responsible for the refinement and spread of the Common tongue from the Old Common of the earliest Sarlonan migrants.</p>\n<p>As @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} spread beyond @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, it made contact with the leaders of the newly created dragonmarked houses, helping to establish the common traditions shared by the houses to this day. As time passed, Sivis would play a critical role in discovering new dragonmarked bloodlines and helping the younger houses establish a foothold in the world. Of all the houses, Sivis has historically had the most interest in the draconic Prophecy and the role of the dragonmarked houses within it. Ever since Alder d'Cannith's assertion that twelve contemporary dragonmarks would one day be found in Eberron, the sages of Sivis searched for the missing marks.</p>\n<p>Despite its influence, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} has never sought to dominate the houses, instead working to be a friend and ally to all. Of course, the gnomes are a subtle people, and many dragonmarked wonder if the vaunted neutrality of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} is not in fact a mask shrouding a far-reaching hidden agenda.</p>\n<p>Though the sending ability of the Sivis heirs has always been treasured, the house's greatest turning point was the development of the speaking stone (ECS 263) in 783 YK. Conceived by Tasker Torralyn d'Sivis and developed by the Twelve, the speaking stone allows Sivis heirs who carry the least mark of the house to transmit messages between stones. In 789 YK, the first Sivis message stations appeared in the capital cities of the Five Nations. Since that time, they have multiplied and spread across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Today, the house continues as it always has, doing its part to stabilize a world torn apart by war. Though some are quick to write off the importance of a house of scribes, Sivis is an invaluable, integral part of modern civilization.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Organizations in House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{People of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis as an Organization]{House Sivis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis in the World]{House Sivis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Sivis]{Playing a Member of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Impartial Voice]{The Impartial Voice}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-sivis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_k6d9algq2g","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"biigdc6MMjMmKqkK","name":"Sharn Watch","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Sharn Watch</h1>\n<p>A common viewpoint among the citizens of Sham is that in the upper wards, the Sham Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they'rejust troublemakers who deserve to be run in.</p>\n<p>As another example, the guards of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dura]{Dura} @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Bazaar]{Bazaar} have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sham Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.</p>\n<p>Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.</p>\n<p>The upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Skyway]{Skyway}, any of the upper or middle wards, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Central]{Lower Central}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Tavick's]{Lower Tavick's} Landing, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Precarious]{Precarious}, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cliffside]{Cliffside}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Menthis]{Lower Menthis}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Northedge]{Lower Northedge}, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Dura]{Lower Dura} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Cogs]{the Cogs}, the Watch's reponse is typically very slow.</p>\n<h2>Sharn Watch Divisions</h2>\n<p>The discussion above primarily concerns the rank and file of the Sham Watch, the guards who walk the streets day in and day out and the officers who supervise them. The Watch also includes a few special divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Blackened Book</strong> is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to their work and their city, and generally don't take bribes. It's up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there's a case that a noble doesn't want investigated, it probably won't be.</p>\n<p><strong>The Guardians of the Gate</strong> came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the district of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.High Walls]{High Walls}. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.</p>\n<p><strong>The Redcloak Battalion</strong> is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don't appreciate being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the interests of the Boromar Clan.</p>\n<h2>Watch Station</h2>\n<p>Sharn Watch stations are located throughout the city. The largest are the garrison posts like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daggerwatch]{Daggerwatch} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sword Point]{Sword Point}; smaller stations in various places are used to hold criminals, dispatch patrols, and take care of dayto-day business.</p>\n<p>A typical Sharn Watch station has two well-guarded entrances. One is connected to a main vestibule, where an officer in a security room with a magically reinforced window signs visitors in and confiscates their spell components, spellcasting focuses, and weapons. The other entrance is a large barred and warded door that leads to the garage, which holds skycoaches and soarsleds. Both of these areas are connected to the station's bullpen by way of locked and warded doors.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6l2u8fsp5zw","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

By those who owe their health or life to the Mark of Healing, Jorasco's name is praised.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Jorasco is not a charity institution. As a dragonmarked house, it is an economic stronghold of epic proportions, offering its services to all who need them—and are able to pay.

The Mark of Healing appeared on the plains not long after the Mark of Hospitality. When Karrn the Conqueror marched southeast, he—and by extension the rest of central Khorvaire—made contact with the Jorasco tribes and the Mark of Healing for the first time. After lengthy negotiations with Karrn's governors and the barons of the other dragon marked houses, Jorasco became a full-fledged house. Unlike the Ghallandas, the Jorascos took pains to integrate themselves into their new society as quickly and completely as possible. In a great migration outward, House Jorasco members established hospitals across Khorvaire, adopting Khorvairan customs and leaving of their tribal heritage behind.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> When the Last War began, House Jorasco immediately started fielding entreaties from the armies of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, each of which wanted medics who bore the Mark of Healing tending to their war casualties. House Jorasco quickly found itself with lucrative contracts with all of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}—contracts that were extended and renegotiated over the course of the next century. Every major campaign of the war had a contingent of House Jorasco healers on the march—and many campaigns had Jorasco healing behind the lines on both sides.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{Baron Ulara d'Jorasco}: </strong>The beloved matriarch of House Jorasco. A scholar first and formost, she has less appetite for politics and diplomacy that most other leaders of Dragonmarked Houses.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Vedykar Enclave:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{Baron Ulara d'Jorasco} rules the house from a walled neighborhood in the Karrnathi city of Vedykar. She rarely leaves her villa except when her expertise is required, but she's far from a recluse. Advisors and functionaries come in and out of her villa in a continuous stream from sunup to sundown.</p>\n<p>The rest of the Vedykar enclave is a series of buildings devoted to particular ailments (one for wasting illnesses, one for trauma, a well-guarded one for madness and other afflictions of mind and spirit, and so on). In the middle of the enclave is a small lake that is one of House Jorasco's greatest attractions. Anyone who bathes in the lake at dawn gains almost complete amnesia, remembering only his or her name and basic life skills such as eating, walking, and speaking. The spot is popular among veterans of the Last War who experienced horrors they wish to forget, and House Jorasco commands a high price for the privilege of bathing in the lake's waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Great Healing Hall:</strong> A city with hundreds of thousands of residents keeps its healers busy, and House Jorasco has several hospitals scattered throughout the City of Towers. The grandest of all is in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragon Towers]{Dragon Towers} district. PCs can find accomplished ritual healers there, including those capable of performing the Raise Dead and Remove Affliction rituals. Healers at the Great Healing Hall are also familiar with many of the exotic diseases and poisons brought back from Xen'drik.</p>\n<p><strong>Hall of a Thousand Mirrors: </strong>In the jungles northeast of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Q'barra]{Q'barran} city of Newthrone is a House Jorasco enclave built on ancient ruins of uncertain origin. The half lings of the enclave maintain their distance from but are not overtly hostile to the dragon born, the Cyran settlers, and the lizardfolk living nearby. They are cautious about unexpected visitors, however, because their enclave is built atop ancient ruins that contain powerful magic.</p>\n<p>The Hall of a Thousand Mirrors is accurately named. Below the stone and wood of the enclave is a maze of corridors; a full-length mirror stands at each junction, making navigation difficult. For most, walking through the Hall of a Thousand Mirrors is merely unnerving. But those suffering from magical curses or madness find that the mirrors somehow display their afflictions—and then their nightmares walk out of the mirrors. If a cursed or maddened visitor can somehow fight off the images and walk through the Hall of a Thousand Mirrors, then the last mirror shows a normal reflection, and sanity and normal life return.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/house-jorasco-healer-in-last-war.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-jorasco-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5h9u5zh9ys4","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

It has two main areas of emphasis: art representing the Brelish spirit (which primarily means any artwork created by a Brelish artist) and antiquities from Xen'drik, which certain people in the Brelish government would like to view as a colony of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. Its Brelish art collection is unequalled, and includes some world-famous works by great masters of antebellum Galifar. Its collection of antiquities is also impressive, though it is small in comparison to that of the Dezina Museum at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Morgrave University]{Morgrave University}</p>\n<h3>The Citadel</h3>\n<p>An imposing, fortified structure near the middle levels of Andith Tower, the Citadel is both the headquarters of the local Knights of the Citadel and the city jail.

The fact that she is a dragonmark heir of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} is her own best-kept secret; not even the majority of her employees are aware of her family connection.

After spending time with a client, they prepare an intelligence report for Athania, who finds interested buyers for any significant items.

The house helped them to maintain order in the kingdom, uncover treasonous conspiracies, and guard against any threat from outside Khorvaire. Phiarlan assassins removed insurgent leaders and other internal threats. On more than one occasion, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} helped to enforce the strange laws of inheritance, such as the ones which prevented the eldest child of Breland's king from ever succeeding to Breland's throne.</p>\n<p>There were occasions, even in a unified Galifar, when the rulers of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} plotted against each other and even against their sovereign, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} was often involved in those schemes.

A house that was more strongly unified to begin with might have been able to remain united even under such circumstances, but @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} had always been fractious. The Mark of Shadow appeared not in one family line but in several, and relations among the Phiarlan lines had been strained in the past.</p>\n<p>Five lines—the Tialaen, Shol, Elorrenthi, Thuranni, and Paelion—were the most prominent and influential families in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} before the schism. Each line had its particular strengths within the broad field of the house's activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together. This lead to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/mark-of-shadow.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_v6ohxlugu8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

For this reason it is often disparaged by the other circles, who assert that it has become a hollow shell choosing members based on pedigree rather than arcane talent… essentially, that its members are more likely to be nobles rather than sages. Members of the Arcane Order must swear to use “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aureon]{Aureon's} Gift” to preserve civilization and in the service of the law. While its diverse membership practice all forms of magic, the schools of evocation, abjuration, and divination have especially strong support in the order.</p>\n<p>Though not the first wizard's circle, this was the first circle to use the term arcane order. The Arcane Order was founded in ancient Daskara by monks devoted to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aureon]{Aureon}, but quickly spread into Thaliost. Bound by the belief that magic should be a force for law and order, the circle were staunch supporters of Galifar I. They provided magical support during his conquest and helped enforce order across the united kingdom in the aftermath. They formed the solid foundation of the Arcane Congress and ensured the Congress served crown and kingdom. It's worth noting that the Princess Aundair was originally a member of the Guild of Moonlight and Whispers—and that Aundair herself was instrumental in convincing the other circles to unite in the Arcane Congress, setting aside the feuds many of the lesser circles had with the Arcane Order. Those feuds continue to this day, but are conducted within the confines of the Congress.</p>\n<p>Over the course of centuries, internal rivalries caused the Arcane Order to split along national lines. This resulted in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland's} Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Erudite Order of eastern @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}. The Arcane Order remained a force in central @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre} and in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}, though its support dropped significantly in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} following the depredations of Sarmondelaryx, the Year of Blood and Fire, and the rise of the Silver Flame. Today the Arcane Order maintains a single hall in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}, in the city of Sigilstar.</p>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_p7ucda8npuk","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/08.

{"_id":"d5rFk9EstBj3fMC9","name":"Khyber's Gate","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Khyber's Gate</h1>\n<p>Khyber's Gate covers the distance between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Ashblack]{Ashblack} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Blackbones]{Blackbones}. Due to the lack of lava streams, it does not have any of the heavy industry found to the east or west. For the most part, Khyber's Gate is a tenement district, fi lled with tiny houses carved into the tunnel walls. A great many of the monstrous immigrants from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} have settled in Khyber's Gate, using strength or supernatural abilities to drive the original residents away. Beyond these monsters, the vast majority of the inhabitants are goblins. The other inhabitants of the Gate are drawn from all races, though they share a common desperation; an elf resident of Khyber's Gate has little in common with one of the haughty inhabitants of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shae Lias]{Shae Lias}. Many of the nongoblin inhabitants of the region are criminals who have fled from justice. Some people have established businesses in the depths, while others travel up to the surface and make a living by begging or stealing. While the vast majority of the trades and services offered in Khyber's Gate are illegal, there are a few people who practice useful mundane trades. </p>\n<p>Khyber's Gate is a community of sorts, and brewers, tailors, and cooks are just as valuable as burglars and assassins. Khyber's Gate is an extremely disorganized region. There is no central authority—it is simply a question of who has the power to enforce their desires. At the moment, Daask is the most powerful force in the undercity. The Cults of the Dragon Below have a strong following in the undercity, but as is often the case, the cults are not a unifi ed force; there are three different sects, and they fi ght one another as often as anyone else. The rakshasa Zathara and zakya Nethatar are powerful and deadly inhabitants of the region, but few people even know of their existence. </p>\n<p>In Khyber's Gate, an adventurer should always be cautious—there's no telling when what appears to be a lowly goblin might turn out to be a vampire, a wererat, a rakshasa, or an even more dangerous fiend.​</p>\n<h2>Khyber's Gate at a Glance</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Ward:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Cogs]{The Cogs}</li>\n<li><strong>District Type: </strong>Tenaments</li>\n<li><strong>Buildings: </strong>Dungeons of at least ten rooms (8), temples (Dragon Below, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Shadow]{the Shadow}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Mockery]{the Mockery}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Fury]{the Fury}), poor lodging (20), poor food (40), average trades (20), poor trades (60), average services (20), poor services (80), poor residences (420)​</li>\n<li><strong>First Impression: </strong>This is an actual city beneath the city, with homes and shops carved into the walls of the Cogs. It is still a maze of passages, but the “streets” are a little wider and the ceilings rise higher. The heat is far less intense that in the industrial district, but the air is still fi lled with the stench of smoke and garbage. Goblins watch from the shadows, and in the distance two ogres stagger out of a bar.​</li>\n<li><strong>Social Class:</strong> Lower class</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Khyber's Gate Highlights</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"black-row\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"2\">Locations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ashtura's Tomb</td>\n<td>Ancient dhakaani tomb of the Warlord Ashtura, hidden deep beneath @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rockache Tavern</td>\n<td>One of the taverns in Khyber's Gate.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shamukaar</td>\n<td>The safest tavern in Khyber's Gate that is used as neutral ground by Daask.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Citadel of the Closed Circle</td>\n<td>The former fortress of the Wizards of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Closed Circle]{Closed Circle}.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Temple of the Six</td>\n<td>The current headquarters of Daask and it's operations in Sharn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Workshop of Tyrial Dashar</td>\n<td>A mighty conjurer created this underground workshop in order to carry out his experiments without placing the city at risk.

Shamukaar is simultaneously a slaughterhouse, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a tavern.</p>\n<p>It caters to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} immigrants, a category that includes many different species; ogres, gnolls, harpies, minotaurs, and even medusas can be found at the bar. The goblin chefs can prepare an astonishing assortment of meals, all of which share one thing in common: they are disgusting to humans.</p>\n<p>Despite the monstrous nature of its patrons, Shamukaar is one of the safest places in Khyber's Gate. Even the monsters of Daask recognize the need for a neutral ground and a safe haven, and Shamukaar serves that purpose. Unless provoked beyond measure, a resident of Khyber's Gate will not start a fight in Shamukaar. And if anyone does start a fight, all other patrons unite together to subdue the aggressor.</p>\n<p>Any nongoblin who eats a meal at Shamukaar must make a Vigor check (-1) or suffer from Mild poison for one hour. A nongoblin who eats at Shamukaar once per day for a week without failing a saving throw gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist the effects of ingested poisons.</p>\n<h3>The Citadel of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Closed Circle]{Closed Circle}</h3>\n<p>In the dawn of Sharn, there were three wizard's circles: The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Esoteric Order of Aureon]{Esoteric Order of Aureon}, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Guild of Starlight and Shadows]{Guild of Starlight and Shadows}, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Closed Circle]{Closed Circle}. The wizards of the Closed Circle were interested in the lore of the daelkyr, and soon developed strong ties to the Cults of the Dragon Below.​</p>\n<p>Eventually their work began to frighten the other two circles; it came to a war of wizards, and the Closed Circle was sealed in its fortress in the undercity.​ Now, centuries later, the Dragon Below has returned to this arcane fortress.​</p>\n<h3>The Temple of the Six</h3>\n<p>Before the rise of the Silver Flame, it was not uncommon to find people who openly worshipped the Dark Six, either hungry for power or making sacrifices to placate the dark gods. Temples to the Six were usually built in hidden places, and when Sharn was created an enormous temple to the Dark Six was constructed beneath the city. In 484 YK, Flamekeeper Jalus Baine led a force of the faithful and exterminated the followers of the Six, and the temple was quickly ransacked. But it was not completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>Currently, it serves as the headquarters of Daask and the home of the ogre mage <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cavallah</em></span>. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cavallah</em></span> respects the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Mockery]{Mockery} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Shadow]{Shadow} and has restored their altars, but for the most part the temple was simply a convenient base of operations. She has established a range of defenses in the temple, and brought a variety of unpleasant beasts from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}: gricks, displacer beasts, basilisks, and an assortment of other deadly creatures. The wealth gathered by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} lies in the vaults of this temple—but seizing it would be a dangerous task.</p>\n<p>Many of the Dark Six have other worshippers in Khyber's Gate, how have established hidden temples; these folk generally practice their faith in private and have little contact with <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cavallah</em></span>.</p>\n<h3>The Wounded Dragon</h3>\n<p>This shop is located in a small side tunnel behind Shamukaar. It has no windows, and the door is locked with seal of the magi. The only indication of its purpose is a small sign above the door, showing a stylized dragon with an injured leg; a few drops of blood fall from its raised foreleg. An alchemist shop that provides Daask with wrath, noxious smokesticks, and other alchemical weapons.​ More importantly, he plays a key role in the dragon's blood trade, selling from his shop. Dragon's blood is smuggled into @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} in an inert, unrecognizable solid form. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cask</em></span> prepares a special salve; when this is applied to the dragon's blood, it restores the drug to its proper consistency. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cask</em></span> cannot create dragon's blood on his own, and he does not know the ingredients of the drug.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_vohphnvcq2k","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"d86yyqkCuSOyURrd","name":"Graywall: Forces within Graywall","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Forces within Graywall</h1>\n<p>Many factions are at work in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]. Although the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters} forged @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] into a nation, tribal and racial ties are still a powerful force within the town. Ambitious warlords such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Tzaryan Rrac} or the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Queen of Stone} might have their own operatives in the town. And then there are the spies, Brelish bandits, and groups of deserters or war criminals drawn from across Khorvaire. Here are descriptions of a few organizations, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<h3>The Flayer Guard</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Korgel Blackblade (male war troll battle champion) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Jalira Stormtongue (evil female bloodfire harpy warlord), Salan (evil male wererat rogue)</p>\n<p>The Flayer Guard, elite soldiers of Droaam, keep the peace in Droaam, but they stand ever ready to face a challenge from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]—or to launch an attack against the eastern kingdoms. The majority of the guards are orcs and minotaurs, along with a few ogres and trolls (remarkably intelligent for their kind, but still saved for brute force operations). The Flayer Guard has a number of special units. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Jalira Stormtongue </em></span>commands a squad of gargoyles and harpy archers who serve as scouts and air support; Jalira's burning song deals lightning and thunder damage. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Salan</em></span> commands a squad of ten small wererats, and they appear as goblins when not in hybrid form. The true core of the Flayer Guard is the team of twenty war trolls, a unit trained by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Sora Maenya}</em></span>. These fearsome soldiers are under the command of <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Korgel Blackblade</em></span>, a war troll of terrifying skill and power, who wields a magic greatsword forged by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Szalas Jal</em></span> from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Tooth and Steel}.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Flayer Guard is utterly devoted to the group's illithid master, due equally to patriotism and psychic conditioning. They are veteran soldiers and use intelligent tactics in combat; players expecting orcs and ogres to be bumbling buffoons are in for an unpleasant surprise.</p>\n<h3>House Tharashk</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader: </strong>Baron Kundran Torrn (male half-orc) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Kel'Ashta (evil male orc), Mor'Ashta (evil male orc bloodrager), Jana Velderan (female human ranger), Lagraa (female half-orc)</p>\n<p>House Tharashk is a powerful force within Graywall, especially within the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{Calabas}. Under <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Baron Kundran Torrn</em></span>, the house has reached out to orcs across the town. Through his generosity and feats in the challenge rings, Kundran has also earned the respect of many of the other inhabitants of Graywall. The Graywall enclave is the hub of a number of different operations, including prospecting within the region, employing and training monsters to serve as mercenaries and laborers in the east, and the usual work of finding anything that needs to be found. Kel'Ashta is a talent scout for mercenaries, who is well connected with the Graywall arena.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Mor'Ashta</em></span> commands the house guard that minds the enclave and maintains order in the Calabas—a mixed force of 20 orc raiders, berserkers, and warriors, along with any monstrous mercenaries currently on hand.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Jana Velderan</em></span> is the chief inquisitive. Jana has faced challenges in Graywall due to her race, but she's good at what she does and has made contacts with many of the local bandits.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Lagraa</em></span> is the spiritual counselor of the enclave, and her nature determines what sort of long-range stories might evolve here. She might be an adept of the Gatekeeper druids, in which case she can call on PC Tharashk heirs to fight aberrations and terrors beneath the town. However, she could be an evil priestess of the Dragon Below, slowing spreading her poisonous beliefs throughout the enclave and calling up horrors from the darkness. If this is the case, the Tharashk enclave could ultimately become the hub for an epic adventure, since Lagraa and her disciples release a daelkyr lord! Will this madness taint all House Tharashk, or has it been contained in Graywall?</p>\n<h3>The Redcaps</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader: </strong>Gurb Bonecrow, also known as the Raven (male goblin hexer wizard) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Reka the Razor (evil female kobold slyblade rogue)</p>\n<p>Inspired by stories of the fey of the same name, this gang is made up of goblins and kobolds, and it operates out of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall}. For thousands of years, the smaller races have been oppressed by larger, more powerful creatures. The Redcaps are dedicated to taking vengeance for these indignities. They enjoy ambushing ogres and trolls on general principle, but specifically target anyone who abuses goblins or kobolds, whether they are locals or foreigners. So far they have not provoked a response from the Flayer Guard, but this could be a matter of time.</p>\n<p>The Redcaps are drawn from multiple tribes. They operate in secret, hiding behind masks and their blood-soaked red caps. The group is led by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Gurb Bonecrow</em></span>, a talented goblin wizard who calls himself “the Raven” when masked; his chief lieutenant is <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Reka the Razor</em></span>, an especially deadly slyblade.</p>\n<h3>The Old Bones</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Zaris Lornath (evil male human warlord) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Cayna (evil female dwarf death master), Desh Anarn (evil male skeleton tomb guardian bodyguard)</p>\n<p>The Old Bones are veteran Karrnathi soldiers— patriots and fanatical followers of the Blood of Vol. However, they are not members of the Order of the Emerald Claw; they have concluded that the leaders of the Emerald Claw are not truly devoted to the principles of the Blood of Vol, nor do they have the best interests of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Karrnath] at heart. They dream of some day driving the treacherous Kaius III from the throne and simultaneously cleansing the ranks of the Seekers.</p>\n<p>Although their goals might appeal to Karrns, the Old Bones are not virtuous champions. Many of them are war criminals who are wanted for acts of extraordinary cruelty during the Last War. The cleric <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cayna</em></span> is infamous for slaughtering prisoners of war so that he could raise them as undead soldiers, and <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zaris Lornath </em></span>ordered many attacks on civilian populations. The Old Bones believe in terror as a tool and necromancy as a weapon, and they stop at nothing to ensure Karrnathi supremacy. The Old Bones could be allies against the Emerald Claw, but they are disturbing allies at best.</p>\n<p>It's up to the DM to decide just how powerful <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zaris</em></span> and <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Cayna</em></span> are. Their greatest ally is <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Desh Anarn</em></span>, a fallen champion of the Blood of Vol returned as a sentient tomb guardian. The circumstances that allowed <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Anarn</em></span> to return with such power remain a mystery; this could be due to his great faith in the Blood of Vol, or he could be a creation of Erandis Vol—a spy sent to watch this splinter group to see if it can be used.</p>\n<h3>The Skinners</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Zurin Souldrinker (male oni night haunter) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Gray Garrak (male bugbear rogue)</p>\n<p>The Mockery is the Sovereign of murder and treachery, and the Skinners believe that he guides their hands. This gang of monsters actively preys on the people of the east, killing foreigners foolish enough to leave the safety of the Calabas—and occasionally venturing within its walls to target an outspoken follower of the Silver Flame or paladin of Dol Arrah. When possible, the Skinners take victims alive so they can be tortured slowly. The leader of this gang is <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Zurin Souldrinker</em></span>; his devour soul power strips the skin from a victim even as it inflicts damage, and it can be used on a target that is either unconscious or helpless. His strong second is <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Gray Garrak</em></span>, a vicious bugbear with a remarkable gift for slaughter.Backdrop Graywall</p>\n<h3>The Swords of Liberty</h3>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Tars Faldren (male human demagogue) <br /><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Tolri (evil female tiefling wizard/ devastator), Norn (male dwarf bodyguard)</p>\n<p>The Swords of Liberty operate in secret within the borders of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Tars Faldren</em></span> is one of the founding members of the organization, and when it became too dangerous for him to remain in Breland, he decided to establish a safe house in Graywall—a haven for Swords on the run and a base of operations from which to openly spread their message. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Faldren</em></span> has been operating out of Graywall since 997 YK, and he has been petitioning foreign governments, speaking with dragonmarked houses and the Korranberg Chronicle, and otherwise spreading his antimonarchy message. Publicly he downplays the violent actions of the Swords of Liberty, but behind the scenes he uses his position to acquire illegal goods for use by his allies in Breland.</p>\n<p>Faldren's safe house is hidden within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone}.

Order and strategy govern all. Your house has taught you from a young age which rules can be bent and which cannot.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Combat training is a staple of life in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth}. Every heir, barring infirmity or other disability, is schooled in martial training from a young age. You are trained not to seek out combat, but you do not shy away from it. You won't break the rules of honorable combat if your opponent requests them, but you won't find yourself hampered by them if he doesn't.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Whether born into the house or not, no one is considered a true heir of Deneith until he has spent at least one year serving as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademark}.

Hirelings are expected to provide their own gear and find their own mentors, while heirs of the house can seek training from within. In a sense, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]{Blademarks Guild} is the training branch of the house, and even experienced heirs who are no longer members of the guild occasionally return for a few months to sharpen their skills</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Denieth]{House Denieth} are expected to risk their lives for their clients.

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland], carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name.

As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair] or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces—natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam’s} many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn’t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Graywall at a Glance</h2>\n<p>Built atop ancient goblin ruins, this town marks the border between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland].

Although it has the trappings of a border town, Graywall is also a military outpost that stands ready to defend the pass against Brelish aggression . . . or to launch a raid, if it comes to that. As such, all members of the labor force undergo basic militia training and can take up arms if necessary. In comparison to the Flayer Guard, this militia is poorly organized and has limited equipment, but the natural abilities of the creatures still make it a force with which to be reckoned.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Now the system is divided, split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the <em>conductor stone</em> paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are involved.</p>\n<p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"800\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How It Works</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p235</span></span></p>\n<p>A lightning rail train is made up of an elemental vessel linked to a series of connected carts, all of which float about 5 feet off the ground. Each cart, similar in form to a large wagon with no wheels, has a <em>conductor stone</em> embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of <em>conductor stones</em> laid out in a line on the ground interacts with the stones in the carts to form a rail for the train to follow. Lightning arcs between the two sets of stones, accounting for the system's name.</p>\n<p>The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains are configured accordingly.</p>\n<p>The other carts that make up the train have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of their elementals are reversed.</p>\n<p>Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others are covered only with canvas.</p>\n<p>Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.</p>\n<p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"801\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Operation.</span></span></p>\n<p>The vessel's pilot, a House Orien dragonmarked heir, stands at the helm, high atop the crew cart, beneath the elemental binding struts. The pilot controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm platform.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The placement of <em>conductor stone</em> lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed based on conditions around the train. When <em>conductor stone</em> lines split, as they do at various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the elemental down the correct line.</p>\n<p>The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and keeping cargo secured.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a title=\"Map 4.10: Lightning Rail Train Carriages\" href=\"https://5e.tools/img/book/ERLW/132-map410_lightningrailcars.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/book/ERLW/132-map410_lightningrailcars.jpg\" /> </a></p>\n<p>Map 4.10: Lightning Rail Train Carriages</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a title=\"(Player Version)\" href=\"https://5e.tools/img/book/ERLW/133-map410_lightningrailcars-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/book/ERLW/133-map410_lightningrailcars-player.jpg\" /> </a></p>\n<p>(Player Version)</p>\n<p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"802\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lightning Rail Stations</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p238</span></span></p>\n<p>Lightning rail stations, where passengers and cargo can be disembarked or loaded, are located in or just outside villages, towns, and cities along the conductor stone paths. There are no stations in the expanses between these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.</p>\n<p>Stations throughout Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold <em>everbright lanterns</em> continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side of the train and the passengers from the other.</p>\n<p>Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house.</p>\n<p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"803\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mysterious Passengers</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p238</span></span></p>\n<p>Lightning rails and airships are good places to encounter a broad sample of Khorvaire's diverse population. You can use the Mysterious Passengers table to bring curious characters in contact with an adventuring party on any kind of journey. Each of these characters might spark an entire new adventure, or might be little more than a momentary diversion.

Embrace the wild.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Doldarun is known for courage, while Droranath is fearless. What’s the difference? A talespinner says that Doldarun is afraid, but even knowing that fear, chooses to stand their ground; in contrast, Droranath never sees any reason to be afraid to begin with. Droranath dwarves value confidence and optimism, and are certain that their strength can carry them through any challenge.</p>\n<p>The Droranath dwarves value tradition, and their culture is the closest to the original Mror path before being conquered by Galifar. The Droranath never became miners; they are hunters, farmers, and above all, fierce warriors. Droranath youths have always trained with axe and hammer, long before Dol Udar made the practice common among the clans, and hide armor is standard fashion among the clan. Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called tra dolhass—the battle cry—a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The “Mror Howlers” are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors. They are one of the smallest and poorest clans, in part due to their violent lifestyle and refusal to embrace many modern advances, but they continue to hold their lands.</p>\n<p>Droranath has fought the Jhorash’tar orcs since the first days of exile. They accuse the orcs of countless atrocities, many of which may have indeed occurred—centuries in the past. Droranath talespinners insist the Jhorash’tar were responsible for the destruction of Noldrunhold, and now claim the orcs are in league with the horrors of the Realm Below. In addition to ongoing skirmishes between Droranath dwarves and the Jhorash’tar, this has led to a bitter feud between Droranath and the clans that support the Jhorash’tar—Toldorath and Tordannon.</p>\n<p>The Droranath dwarves aren’t miners, and they haven’t opened paths to the Realm Below in their territory. However, Droranath mercenaries have served other clans, and brought back trophies from their battles. It’s Droranath tradition to claim the arms and armor of fallen foes, and the Droranath have no qualms about using symbiont weapons, though they don’t celebrate them as Soldorak and Narathun do.</p>\n<p>Droranath characters are often outlanders or folk heroes, as they are always willing to take risks to help friends. Rangers and barbarians are sound choices for Droranath; rangers are usually hunters, while those who practice tra dolhass might be berserkers or ancestral guardians.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

While these are tangible benefits, a second point is that in means that you have peers. As we've always said, true wizards are rare and remarkable. If you're in an arcane order, you know other wizards and artificers. They could provide you with useful leads or insights for your adventures. You could learn spells from the order's library; if a DM wants to limit spell access, it could be that certain orders are the only place to acquire a specific unusual spell, because <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Maximillian Hysian</em></span> of the Esoteric Order created Maximilian's Earthen Grasp. It can also be a fun source of rivals—whether establishing that you have a friendly rivalry with a member of your own order, or a more bitter feud with a member of another order. It is the case that not all arcane scholars use the wizard or artificer class; there could be a sage in your circle who knows 5th level spells even though they can't cast them, or someone capable of creating magic items even though they don't have the full abilities of an artificer.</p>\n<h3>Membership Benefits</h3>\n<p>Someone accepted into an arcane order must pay 1 ,000 gp to join, with ongoing dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many benefits, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.</li>\n<li>For as long as you have access to the order's hall, the cost of crafting a magic item at the site is reduced by 10 percent.</li>\n<li>While in the hall, you have a +2 bonus to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Cosmology]{Cosmology}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Research]{Research}, as well as any ability checks involving arcane research.</li>\n<li>Membership in an arcane order grants prestige within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}.

However, there are other cabals of mages that aren't so open. The <strong>Court of Shadows</strong> is a league of warlocks and wizards inspired by Sul Khatesh.

The half-elves of Lyrandar might be farmers, sailors, raincallers, or diplomats serving the interests of the Khoravar people. Regardless of trade, they are united by racial pride and a firm belief in the future of their house.</p>\n<h2>JOINING @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}</h2>\n<p>Since the days of Lyran and Selavash, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} has been a haven for the Khoravar people. The viceroys of the house actively encourage any half-elves to join the house guilds, and any Khoravar who shows exceptional skill has a chance to be adopted into the house. Members of other races can serve in the guilds, but they are often excluded from holding high office. Lyrandar heirs are strongly discouraged from marrying any but other Khoravar, and in the past, this was grounds for excoriation.</p>\n<p>The majority of the low-ranking members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} are aristocrats, experts, and magewrights, while talented heirs often follow the path of the bard, rogue, swashbuckler, or wizard. Raincallers and members of the organization known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Sela's Path} can be priests, clerics, adepts, or even druids. Over the course of the last century, a number of heirs have become artificers, seeking to reduce Lyrandar's dependence on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith][House Cannith} for the bound-elemental vessels that are its lifeblood.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{Half-elf}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} by blood, marriage or adoption.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The majority of members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} are tied to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}. Whether shipwrights, sailors, navigators, guides, or guards, they treat the sea as a second home. Those heirs who choose not to serve in the guilds focus on the overall administration of the house, often serving as advocates for the Khoravar race. The vision of the Firstborn remains at the core of House Lyrandar, and heirs continue to work toward their vision of a unified Khoravar race—and, potentially, a Khoravar homeland.</p>\n<p>Though some houses put pressure on scions to become agents, Lyrandar encourages a certain level of independence among its heirs. The house often supports the wayward lives of its adventuring scions, with the understanding that these prodigals will someday return to the fold and put their skills to work.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>Lyrandar is one of the most widespread houses geographically, and house heirs can take easy advantage of Lyrandar's reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> A member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} in good standing with the house can usually secure free passage on a Lyrandar vessel, provided that he is willing to work during the voyage. If he wants all the privileges and comforts of a guest, or if he seeks passage for his companions as well, he can obtain a 50% discount on the fare.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear:</strong> Lyrandar heirs with enough wealth can purchase mundane ships, elemental vessels, and the equipment associated with either at 75% of normal cost.

{"_id":"fEOK4IwVZcvQ9VGd","name":"The Ruling Clans (Copy)","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Ruling Clans</h1>\n<p>The Mror Holds are divided into twelve holds, each bearing the name of the ruling clan that exercises authority within that region. These twelve clans are the foundation of Mror culture, and every citizen owes allegiance to one of these clans. This section provides an overview of the twelve ruling clans, including their most remarkable mineral resources, their established feuds, and the virtues they assign to their mythic founder—and thus, the virtues they strive to embody. It’s worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun’s defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner bards and entertainers are found in every clan.</p>\n<p>While all Mror are bound to one of the ruling clans, there are many lesser clans, and below those, tenant families. In creating a Mror character, it’s up to you whether your character is tied directly to a ruling clan or if you’re part of a lesser family. While many Mror take inspiration from their ruling clan, they don’t all share the same virtues; in creating a Mror family of your own, you can decide what their celebrated virtues are.</p>\n<p>Among the Mror, the dwarven subraces largely reflect their culture and personal aptitude, not bloodlines, and a Mror dwarf can take any subrace. For example, mountain dwarves have expanded martial training, likely due to militia service in Dol Udar, while dwarves with the Mark of Warding have a blood tie to House Kundarak in their family tree.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The plane’s title, “Realm of Madness,” is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations . . . and this may be more accurate. Where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lamannia]{Lamannia} embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It’s a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don’t see, ones they’re illequipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace—all of these are inventions. They’re the foundations mortal lives are built on . . . but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.</p>\n<p>Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat.

When mortals die, their souls are drawn to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dulurrh]{Dulurrh}. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat’s also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn’t evil or destructive. It’s part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lamannia]{Lamannia} is the blueprint for nature, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daanvi]{Daanvi} provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been—and of the unseen ways it is.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>To mortal eyes, Xoriat may seem more chaotic than Kythri. However, it’s not defined by the idea of chaos; rather, mortals don’t understand the logic that guides its changes. Additionally, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Kythri]{Kythri's} constant change is still always natural: fire and lightning, stone and water. On the other hand, in Xoriat, a tornado might be composed of ink. Each grain in a sandstorm could be a miniature bust of Queen Aurala of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, or a tiny beating heart. It’s not simply chaotic; it’s unnatural.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/xoriat-symbol.webp\" width=\"304\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Unpredictable Magic.</strong> Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook.</p>\n<p><strong>Dangerous Revelations. </strong>Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it’s afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). If it later fails this saving throw an additional time, its previous madness effect is replaced with a new one.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Is an Illusion. </strong>More than any other plane, time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It’s even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time, as discussed in the next section.</p>\n<p><strong>Strange Reality. </strong>The things adventurers rely on—gravity, time, their identity itself—aren’t always reliable in Xoriat. When characters enter a new layer, the DM can choose a property from the Properties of Xoriat table. This property could apply the entire time the adventurers are on that layer, or it could change when combat begins, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, or at any other time the DM chooses. There are no saving throws against these effects, and an effect impacts all creatures in the layer until the DM replaces that property with a new one. In describing a property, don’t just describe the effect, but explain how it manifests. Haste and slow reflect a shift in the local flow of time. When creatures can detect thoughts, they can hear the thoughts of others flowing like music all around them, and if they concentrate on a single creature, they can translate the meaning of the melody. Each effect reflects a strange new property of reality in this layer.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>The seals of the Gatekeepers block travel to Xoriat, but there are still many ways the Realm of Madness can affect the world.</p>\n<h3>Manifest ZOnes</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Xoriat are common in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, but rare elsewhere. The effects of a Xorian manifest zone are rarely as dramatic as the alien attributes of the plane itself. However, manifest zones may convey one or more of the universal properties of the plane. The most common is the Dangerous Revelations property. People who linger in a Xorian zone often find alien concepts creeping into their brains, instilling strange beliefs, or twisting their sense of reality. These zones can easily produce cults of the Dragon Below; in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the Gatekeepers struggle to keep people out of these zones, while Marcher cultists consider them to be sacred sites.</p>\n<p>Unpredictable Magic is another common property; such zones often have unnatural flora or fauna, but these effects are unreliable and change with each generation. The properties of Time Is an Illusion and Strange Reality are rare in manifest zones, and may not be active all the time; these effects might only become active when Lharvion is full, or when disturbing rituals are performed.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>The last time Xoriat was coterminous, the daelkyr brought their armies through the walls of reality and laid waste to the Empire of Dhakaan. The seals crafted long ago by the Gatekeeper druids keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber, but they also keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous. Xoriat’s remote phases have no known effect, and like Kythri, they’re unpredictable, though the phases tend to come and go far more slowly than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Kythri]{Kythri's} do. There are no recorded instances of citizens of the Five Nations visiting Xoriat; most scholars believe that the Gatekeeper seals prevent all planar travel . . . though someone may have secretly built an eldritch machine in a manifest zone, perhaps incorporating illithid brains or the position of the moon Lharvion. What would happen if the adventurers stumbled on a cult of the Dragon Below just as the cult completes its sinister rituals?</p>\n<h3>Xorian artifaCts</h3>\n<p>The most common artifacts of Xoriat are the symbiont items created by the daelkyr. Examples of these living items can be found in chapter 7 of this book, as well as in chapter 5 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. However, adventurers could stumble on artifacts brought to Eberron by the daelkyr in their great incursion—or relics even more ancient. One effect of Xorian items could be to twist time. On a minor level, this could explain the powers of a cloak of displacement; it always shows you a few seconds ahead of your current position. A more powerful artifact could allow travel through time, or reset time in a small region. Does the time tunnel allow a return trip, or are those who use it trapped on the other side?</p>\n<p>Xoriat is also known for granting maddening knowledge and physical transformation. Either of these effects could be reflected by supernatural gifts, as presented in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The character’s blood is replaced with a sentient protoplasm that whispers to them while they sleep. It grants the benefits of a blessing of wound closure.</li>\n<li>The character gains the blessing of understanding, but they also learn that any time they cast a spell, something dies. When they cast a cantrip, it might be a rodent or a bird. The more powerful the spell, the more significant the death. The caster will likely never see this effect occur, but they know that someone somewhere is paying the price for their magic . . . and worse, this might be true of all spellcasters.</li>\n<li>The character gains the blessing of Valhalla. The spirit warriors it summons are friends of the caster, plucked from the future; the character may not have met all of them yet, but they’re people who the character knows or will know. They’re returned to the future in an hour or when they drop to 0 hit points . . . in which case they may die upon being returned to their own time.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/xoriat-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ow2d3nkcfkp","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

In addition to serving powerful Droaamish spirits and sponsoring gambling, Banor runs a blood gin den in his basement—a home away from home for a growing number of dissolute exiles. Banor has contacts throughout the town, and PCs looking to find someone or something in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone} could find him to be a valuable ally.

This showcases many wonders recovered from Xen'drik and other expeditions, though anything truly valuable tends to be sold by the university.​</p>\n<p>​Home to the finest collection of artifacts from Xen'drik in Khorvaire, Morgrave University's Dezina Museum fills many of the mid-levels of Dalannan Tower. Its collection would be even more impressive were it not for the strong tendency the University has to sell valuable artifacts rather than put them on display, not to mention the steady stream of items routinely stolen from the museum. More interesting (at least to some) than the museum's displayed collection are its vaults, vast rooms below the publicly accessible areas of the museum that contain unopened crates of treasures waiting to be cataloged, shelves of artifacts deemed uninteresting, and a few secret rooms holding items too important or dangerous to put on public display.​</p>\n<h2>Great Hall of Aureon</h2>\n<p>​The grand temple to the god of knowledge at Morgrave University, the Great Hall of Aureon is an architectural marvel as well as a sacred site often visited by pilgrims. Scholars, scientists and artificers, and any others who seek knowledge have made a practice of spending the night in the Great Hall. They believe that inspiration will visit them while they sleep on the marble floor of the majestic temple. Some of Breland's greatest minds through the ages have claimed that their greatest breakthroughs came after a night in the temple. Merrix d'Cannith (the grandfather of the current head of House Cannith in Sharn) attributed the invention of living constructs (the first warforged) to a stay in the Great Hall of Aureon. </p>\n<p>The Great Hall also provides a place to find experts in all fields. The temple staff represents the broad spectrum of scientific study, and if they do not know the answer to a question they can almost certainly find someone who does. The ordained clergy of the Great Hall include experts, wizards, loremasters, and bards, as well as clerics, and position in the hierarchy of the temple has nothing to do with character class or field of expertise.​</p>\n<p>​Devoted to the Sovereign of Law and Lore, this grand temple is an architectural marvel as well as a sacred site. Many scholars and sages make the pilgrimage and spend one night in the Great Hall, hoping that inspiration will strike them as they sleep; stories say Merrix d'Cannith first conceived of the warforged after spending the night in the general temple. The staff of the temple are devoted to their faith—a rarity in Sharn—as well as to the general acquisition of knowledge. Most priests are also experts in a particular field of study and are usually happy to share their knowledge with students.​</p>\n<h2>Hadrill Gardens</h2>\n<p>Aundair Spire is crowned by the magnificent Hadrill Gardens, an extraordinary display of exotic plants, flowers, and even plant creatures from around the world. Access to the more dangerous plants is restricted to students in the botany department who have permission from a faculty member. There are nine greenhouses (including one devoted to orchids from Xen'drik and Q'barra) and a large open-air garden that is a popular site for romantic walks and meditation among both students and staff.​</p>\n<h2>Lareth Hall</h2>\n<p>Named after the founder of Morgrave University, Lareth Hall holds the University's administrative and faculty offices. This large domed structure at the center of the campus, situated at the top of Dalannan Tower, contains the office of president Larrian ir'Morgrave, along with the bursar's and registrar's offices, and—in a large chamber at the top of the dome—the abode of Flamewind, a gynosphinx.​</p>\n<h2>Morgrave University Library</h2>\n<p>​The Morgrave University Library stretches down below Dalannan Proper, with levels and levels of stacks below the public reading rooms. While the library has its limits—including a level of disorganization that results in texts being randomly lost in the stacks for decades—it is the most extensive collection in Breland.​</p>\n<p>​Centrally located on the University campus near the top of Dalannan Tower (just below the dome of Lareth Hall), the Morgrave University Library has the most extensive collection of Books of Khorvaire in all of Breland. It pales in comparison to the great library at Korranberg, but a significant number of Zilargo expatriates live in Den'iyas and work to make the Morgrave Library the best resource it can be.</p>\n<p>History is clearly a specialty of the University, and those using the Morgrave Library for research into the history of Sharn or Xen'drik gain a +6 circumstance bonus on their Knowledge (history) checks. The Library offers a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (history) checks related to other areas and on Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Knowledge (geography) checks. For all other Knowledge checks, the Library provides a +2 circumstance bonus. </p>\n<p>Those without formal ties to Morgrave University must pay a fee of 1 gp per day to conduct research at the Library. Students, alumni, and those working for Morgrave can use the Library for free.​</p>\n<h2>Shava House</h2>\n<p>​Shava House, a small academic community on the campus of Morgrave University, was originally a housing unit for professors with no families. It has developed into more of an intentional community: the residents share meals heavily laden with academic discourse, and generally share an interest in the history of Xen'drik. ​</p>\n<p>​​Shava House is a fine apartment complex, housing many scholars dedicated to the study of antiquities. The air is thick with academic discussion of ancient lands and relics, especially Xen'drik and its mysteries. Word spreads quickly about anything of note that occurs in the complex. ​</p>\n<p>​An unassuming member of this commune is Dala Arand—a friendly scholar active in planning expeditions to Xen'drik, while also secretly serving as a spy for the Order of the Emerald Claw.​</p>\n<h2>The Commons</h2>\n<p>​Pleasantly situated atop Breland Spire, the Commons is a large open-air plaza with a commanding view of the neighboring towers and lower reaches of the city. Every morning, vendors wheel their carts up to the Commons and offer a mouth-watering variety of food from a dozen different cuisines, from Karrnathi sausage to Talentan kebabs. The offerings are hardly haute cuisine, but they are authentic and generally delicious.​</p>\n<p>This massive rooftop garden serves as a space for reflection, public events, and meals; vendors at the edge of the Commons offer a wide range of culinary options. A wide bridge connects the Commons to Dalannan Proper. One side of this bridge holds little shops and vendors catering to students, while the opposite side is the standard place to display notices of interest to students.​</p>\n<h2>The Morgrave Bridge</h2>\n<p>​The long, arcing, covered bridge that connects Breland Spire (and the Commons) to Dalannan Tower serves as a center of student life at Morgrave. Shops line one side of the bridge, including bookstores, paper makers, clothing and equipment vendors catering to students, and related businesses. Notices, such as announcements of campus events, job opportunities, items for sale, rooms for rent, and the like, cover the opposite wall of the bridge.​</p>\n<h2>The Vaults</h2>\n<p>​Below the Morgrave University Library lie the Vaults. These hold crates of relics waiting to be catalogued, shelves of oddities deemed to have little monetary or academic value, and a few heavily secured chambers holding artifacts deemed too valuable or dangerous to be put on display.​</p>\n<h2>Valdain Museum of Natural History</h2>\n<p>​Underfunded and unappreciated at a university so focused on ancient ruins and relics, the Valdain Museum is nevertheless a fascinating collection of carefully stuffed and mounted animals from across Khorvaire and beyond. The exhibits go far beyond mundane animals to include a wide variety of magical beasts, from blink dogs and displacer beasts to a great bulette, and an enormous dragon skeleton hangs from the ceiling above the museum entrance. The Valdain Museum is located near the top of Karrnath Spire.​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_cflz351a55t","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Much of the town is designed to accommodate Large creatures, and the Hydra Halls have high ceilings and rooms with bunks large enough for trolls and ogres. But goblins are the single most numerous race in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}, and Little Graywall is built for them. Every building is designed for Small creatures. The goblin artisans produce goods for the Flayer Guard and the rest of the town, and workhouses have high ceilings and doors allowing ogres easy access to the goods they haul between districts. But all other aspects of the district—from furniture to the flagons served at Black Bahiri's—are designed with Small creatures in mind.</p>\n<p>The goblins and kobolds of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} are proud of the measure of independence they have gained under the rule of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell}, and Little Graywall is the symbol of this. Although there are tribal rivalries, goblins of different tribes almost always unite to fight a larger foe. As a result, the natives of this district are unusually bold here in their home, and they are less likely to put up with abuse from outsiders.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Inns: </strong>Black Bahiri's.</li>\n<li><strong>Taverns: </strong>None (Black Bahiri's).</li>\n<li><strong>Supplies: </strong>None.</li>\n<li><strong>Dragonmarked Services: </strong>None.</li>\n<li><strong>Temples: </strong>No public temple, though most warrens have their own idols or shrines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>KEY LOCATIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Tribal Warrens: </strong>Each goblin or kobold tribe has its own building, which is a structure that serves both as workhouse and barracks. Symbols painted over the door or embedded in the walls indicate the tribe that lives within: the Bone Crows, Hammer-Knockers, Hidden Hands, Stonebreakers, and others. By and large, each tribe focuses on a specific trade; the Stonebreakers work in the mines and quarries, while the Hammer-Knockers are blacksmiths and armorers.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Bahiri's: </strong>A single grist mill is in the Little Graywall, and most of the inhabitants dine there or make meals within their warrens. However, one inn has gained a measure of renown throughout Graywall. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Black Bahiri</em></span> is remarkably fat for a goblin; he is also a talented chef skilled in both Droaamish and Talentan cuisines. Thanks to under-the-table deals he gets prime materials from the Skin Factory in Bloodstone, and his Talentan preparations might be the most palatable food an easterner can find outside the Twilight Palace. Bahiri has rooms for rent, and there are a few gnome and halfling exiles who make their homes here. Some believe that Black Bahiri's is a center for intrigue; there are rumors that the gnome who calls herself <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Shiv</em></span> is a top agent of the Trust, and that Bahiri is a master spy from the Shaarat'khesh. These things might be true, or they might be pure fantasy. But if one is looking for a good meal accompanied by goblin song and cheerful company, Black Bahiri's is a fine choice. Bahiri does keep blood gin on hand for foreigners, but he does not sell the drug to goblins. <br /><span style=\"color:#ba372a\"><strong>Cost: </strong></span>Renting a room at Black Bahiri's costs 1 gp per night; since he has a limited number of rooms, Bahiri might turn down an unpleasant customer.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Death: </strong>Many people come to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} in search of goods they cannot legally buy in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} . . . such as poison.

Some say that he is part of the Shaarat'khesh, while others claim <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Swift</em></span> learned his trade poisoning ogres who abused his tribe. Arranging a meeting with <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Swift</em></span> requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Tasks}, with any goblinoids getting a +1 to their rolls. It's up to the DM to decide just what <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Swift</em></span> has available at any given time, but he's one of the best sources of poison in western Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Never miss an opportunity.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Kolkarun dwarves aren’t the wealthiest clan, but they are skilled negotiators and are one of the more active clans in the wider world. Some Kolkarun dwarves believe that their mythic founder was Kol Korran, though they don’t like to brag about it. They’ve established strong ties to Aundair, Karrnath, Zilargo, and the Talenta Holds, and Kolkarun diplomats played a critical role in securing Karrnathi support for recognition of the Holds. Kolkarun has had many alliances and feuds over the centuries, but always manages to trick others into fighting its battles. Rivals say “Kolkarun’s mother was a gnome,” and assert that Kolkarun dwarves are cowards and opportunists. The Kolkarun shrug and respond, “Only a fool passes up an opportunity.” Currently, they have strong ties to Mroranon, which relies on their support in the Iron Council and makes use of Kolkarun as ambassadors and spies, and they have maintained strong ties to Soldorak since the Exile. Many of the most powerful members of the Aurum are Kolkarun dwarves.</p>\n<p>Kolkarun dwarves are the most adept sailors of the Mror. While they don’t focus their efforts on fishing, they have long been the primary sailors ferrying goods along Mirror Lake and facilitating trade and transit within the holds. However, House Lyrandar produces better ships than the Mror ever did, and today Kolkarun sailors are often licensed by Lyrandar.</p>\n<p>Kolkarun was quick to explore the Realm Below before the threat was known, but even they proved unable to negotiate with the horrors of the deep. Kolkarun holds a few outposts in Sol Udar—often with the help of Droranath mercenaries—but hasn’t made strong offensive moves in recent decades.</p>\n<p>Kolkarun dwarves are among those most likely to travel, and Kolkarun entertainers, sailors, and merchants can be found across Khorvaire. Most of the Iron Council’s spies are Kolkarun; the charlatan background works well for both clever merchant and freelance spy. Bard is a reasonable choice for a Kolkarun character, and they’re among the few dwarves with a true interest in lore.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"gI1iQyYHhDKkvyES","name":"Wroat","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Wroat</h1>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<p><strong>Metropolis</strong><br /><strong>Population:</strong> 360,000</p>\n</div>\n<p>The second largest city in Breland, Wroat serves as the Brelish capital and a center of trade and commerce. Not as densely populated or as overwhelming as Sharn, Wroat nevertheless holds its own as one of the great cities of Khorvaire. Wroat, whose skyline stretches along both sides of the Howling River, is located at the junction where that waterway meets the Dagger River. Two large temples—one dedicated to the Sovereign Host, the other to the Silver Flame— dominate the Street of Worship. Other impressive structures include Brokenblade Castle, Parliament Hall, the Citadel, the Wroat campus of Morgrave University, and the Galifar Museum.</p>\n<p>Humans and gnomes live here in the greatest numbers, along with significant populations of eladrin, elves, and half-elves. Representatives of all the other races are present as well. As Breland's capital, Wroat welcomes visitors from all over the continent. All dragon marked houses have emporiums in the city, and House Medani runs its entire industry from here. The house's leader has a long and well-known friendship with the king and lends his house's service to protect the crown from spies and assassins.</p>\n<p>As the nation's capital, Wroat is a hotbed of political activity. The aristocracy and the elected members of parliament spend a lot of time here, debating the issues of the day and keeping the wheels of government turning. Diplomats from all over the world maintain lodgings and embassies in the city's Foreign District. The crown operates out of Brokenblade Castle, where King Boranel and his family live and work for a sizable portion of the year. The heads of all the royal agencies also operate out of Wroat, where they can be close to both the king and the parliamentary leaders.</p>\n<p>Boranel's court travels with the king, but it displays all of its grandeur and majesty here in the capital city. Keeping most of the traditions of ancient Galifar alive, the court conducts business, plans festivities, engages entertainment, and otherwise handles the duties of serving the crown and king. The Brelish court is known far and wide for the lavish celebrations it holds, as well as for the fair and just treatment it dispenses to its subjects.</p>\n<h2>Notable Locations</h2>\n<h3>Brokenblade Castle</h3>\n<p>The royal residence rises from an island in the middle of the Howling River. Two bridges connect the isle to the south bank. Streets climb a steep hill and end at the tall gate set in the castle's high stone walls. According to legend, the castle takes its name from Galifar's conquest. At one point while in these lands, he broke his blade in battle but somehow managed to win the day. He had the fortress built to commemorate the victory, and it's said the blade remains inside its walls still.</p>\n<p>Brokenblade Castle contains royal apartments, garrisons, armories, kitchens, and other rooms and features necessary to keep the place in full operation. King Boranel spends two-thirds of every year traveling, so his brother Kor ir'Wynarn oversees the castle when not attending to his responsibilities at the King's Citadel.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.King's Citadel]{The King's Citadel}</h3>\n<p>Breland's elite military service (also known as the King's Citadel, or simply the Citadel) operates from this obsidian tower. It contains offices, headquarters, residences, and training grounds for the force of warriors, mages, and spies who serve at the king's pleasure.</p>\n<h3>Parliament Hall</h3>\n<p>The legislative branch of the Brelish government operates out of an historic facility on the southern shore of the Howling River. The Parliament Hall consists of two chambers and a series of surrounding offices. Each member of the Parliament and their staffs have an office in the building, but the real work of the Parliament takes place within the two meeting chambers.</p>\n<p>The Noble Chamber provides space for the hereditary members of Parliament to meet and debate the issues before them. These are the representatives of the noble families of Breland, and all twenty-seven have a seat in Parliament.</p>\n<p>The Commons Chamber provides similar space for the legislators that are elected by popular vote. These are the representatives of villages, towns, and cities that stretch across the Brelish countryside; each serves a two-year term, but reelection is commonplace.</p>\n<p>When the full Parliament gets together to vote on pressing matters, the wall between the two chambers is removed, creating a single large hall.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/locations/city-of-wroat-from-above.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Orcs, ogres, minotaurs, and gnolls make up the bulk of the population, while the troop of war trolls form an impressive (if small) segment of it. Aside from the soldiers, goblins and orcs can be seen performing menial tasks and civilian jobs. Foreigners are not welcome here, and few humans or other easterners are visible.</p>\n<p><strong>Character: </strong>For all that it can be seen as a center for trade, Graywall is a military outpost on the border of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, and the Karda is the fortress at the heart of the town. High, thick walls surround the district. Foot soldiers patrol the streets, and harpies and gargoyles circle overhead. The gates are open, but the minotaur sentries question any who wish to enter, demanding to know the business that takes them to the Karda. Foreigners are treated with suspicion and might be questioned by patrols.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Inns: </strong>None.</li>\n<li><strong>Taverns: </strong>None.</li>\n<li><strong>Supplies: </strong>None.</li>\n<li><strong>Dragonmarked Services: </strong>Ghallanda; Jorasco; Kundarak; Orien; Phiarlan; Sivis; Tharashk.</li>\n<li><strong>Temples: </strong>No public temples, though there are shrines in the barracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>KEY LOCATIONS</h2>\n<p>No businesses are in the Karda. There is a grist mill for the soldiers, but no public amenities. It is a fortress, with barracks for the Flayer Guard and Znir Pact, armories, and other facilities needed to hold the citadel in the face of a siege.</p>\n<p><strong>The Keep:</strong> The seat of <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Xor'chylic's</em></span> power, the Keep is the strangest building in Graywall. The mind flayer took a personal hand in its design, and its walls are whorled and rounded; at times they gleam with an iridescent sheen. Fifty elite troops are garrisoned within the tower, and it is fortified to withstand a siege. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Xor'chylic's</em></span> throne sits on the third floor, and he spends most of his time in this great seat, listening to the thoughts of the town and plotting an incomprehensible revenge against the lords of Xoriat.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last Tower: </strong>This is the courthouse of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall}. It is also the last place many of those who come before a magistrate ever see. The tower serves both as a prison and as a center for torture. Droaamish law doesn't believe in incarceration as a form of rehabilitation, and prisoners are only held if they are waiting for transfer, execution, or serving a sentence in the arena (which can last days or weeks). Public executions are held in the plaza, and statues are also arranged around the tower—these are victims petrified by the medusa magistrate and left as a warning to others. Typically, the justice has the right hand of a petrified victim removed, to ensure that if the victim is restored it is at least maimed.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: The Karda (The Throne)]{The Karda (The Throne)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

It is one of the youngest of the houses, formed only at the end of the War of the Mark, though it had existed informally for some time in pre-Galifar @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. Medani primarily works for clients in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} and central Khorvaire, but its agents are found across the continent.</p>\n<h2>JOINING @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}</h2>\n<p>The half-elf blood of Medani has a strong influence on the views of the house. Accustomed to walking between worlds, the house values the racial heritage that allows its members to move in both elf and human society with ease. Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}, Medani favors occasional intermarriage to elves or humans, both as a means of renewing the connection to its ancestral blood and to add to the house's expansive social connections. Other races are not considered candidates for marriage, and such matches are actively frowned upon by house elders.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} is not so particular when it comes to its hirelings. Any individual with the proper aptitude can apply to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild}, be granted certification, and work under the house banner, if not for the house itself.</p>\n<p>This is particularly true in Wroat and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, but even in Medani's smaller enclaves, the house typically hires individuals based on talent alone. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} prizes critical thinkers of all types. Spellcasting ability is valued, but is not considered a replacement for an analytical mind and keen judgment. Members of the house gravitate toward the classes of expert, rogue, and bard.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{Half-elf}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{elf}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{human}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related by blood or marriage to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Warning Guild} learn quickly that they must make their own way in the world. Medani is not the most powerful house, nor the most populous. The strengths of its members are keen insight and a learned ability to predict the actions of those around them based on the evidence at hand. To that end, the house employs its members not in the collection of intelligence (the long-standing purview of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} and, more recently, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}), but in counterintelligence. Medani does not traffic in secrets; it helps to keep them.</p>\n<p>Medani agents and inquisitives work to detect and disrupt the theft of goods and information. Some focus on the more traditional physical methods of doing so; others take a more subtle approach. All Medani heirs train in close combat, with a focus on surprise tactics.

Recognized as a single allied nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, the principalities are more of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on the open seas.</p>\n<p>The Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the principalities into a unified force.

Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your DM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Local Customs.</strong> Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your DM to develop one that fits your character.</p>\n<p><strong>Big Dreams.</strong> Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Cites and Settlements</h2>\n<p>Among the myriad ports and pirate redoubts of the Lhazaar Principalities are ancient ruins from forgotten civilizations that predate even the Dhakaani Empire, as well as tombs built by wealthy pirates and sea lords to house their treasures and earthly remains.</p>\n<p>Presented below are a handful of the most widely known—if hard to find—places in the principalities.</p>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Verge]{Port Verge}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Blackrock]{Blackrock}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cornerstone (Lorghalen)]{Cornerstone}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Juna]{Juna}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cliffscrape]{Cliffscrape}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Krez]{Port Krez}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Taer Lian Doresh]{Taer Lian Doresh}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>Isles of the Lhazaar Principalities</h2>\n<p>The Lhazaar Principalities are full of a number of islands.</p>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Farlnen]{Farlnen}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lorghalen]{Lorghalen}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Greentarn]{Greentarn}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lastpoint]{Lastpoint}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Orgalos]{Orgalos}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Orthoss]{Orthoss}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tempest Isle]{Tempest Isle}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Hammer]{The Hammer}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Trebaz Sinara]{Trebaz Sinara}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>Sites of Note</h2>\n<p>Beyond the settlements that populate the Principalities, there are a number of other notable locations.</p>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dreadhold]{Dreadhold}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide]{Gray Tide}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gulf of Ingjand]{Gulf of Ingjand}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Ship of Bones]{Ship of Bones}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Starkwood]{Starkwood}</h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n</div>\n<h2>Power Groups in the Lhazaar Principalities</h2>\n<p>The balance of power is far from stable among the Lhazaarites.

By the time King Galifar I was uniting the Five Nations, the Principalities were well established, as was their inhabitants’ well-deserved reputation as raiders and pirates. When Galifar proclaimed that his kingdom “stretched across the width and breadth of Khorvaire,” the Lhazaar princes ignored him. Their domains were far from the great cities of the Five Nations, separated by a formidable mountain range and the endless seas over which the princes ruled supreme.</p>\n<p>By 28 YK, King Galifar had fortified his hold over the Five Nations and turned his attention to the threat from the east. The Lhazaar princes and sea barons were wreaking havoc among the coastal communities, interfering with shipping and refusing to bend to the will of the crown. Thus began the Galifar–Lhazaar War, a series of naval engagements that lasted nearly a decade. The sea barons knew the currents better and started out with better vessels, but Galifar dedicated his efforts to building a powerful navy. Aided by magic and the help of some of the dragonmarked houses, Galifar was able to garner enough victories to force the Lhazaar princes to meet to discuss terms. In the end, the Principalities became part of Galifar’s kingdom but remained autonomous, the Lhazaar princes more or less independent within their own domains yet agreeing to pay tribute to Galifar and recognize him as the legitimate ruler of the mainland kingdom.</p>\n<p>For the next eight hundred years, the Lhazaar princes continued to live in relative harmony with the Five Nations. Lhazaar pirates slowly developed into traders and explorers, keeping their illicit activities to a minimum so as not to attract the attention of Galifar’s ever-improving navy. When the Last War broke out, the Lhazaar princes initially stayed out of the fray. As the months of conflict and unresolved issues of rulership wore on, the princes decided that their longstanding agreement was with the united Galifar, not the individual successor kingdoms. With the kingdom shattered, the princes felt no obligation to honor the ancient pact.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>AFTERMATH OF THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>During the Last War, the Lhazaar served as privateers and pirates. Outsiders wonder if the principalities can adapt to peace, or if their thirst for gold and adventure will lead their subjects to ruin.</p>\n<p>Most of the princes are content with their domains, but ambitious rulers such as Prince Ryger of Regalport and Prince Kolberkon of Port Verge could shatter the status quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal power, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified nation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the dragonmarked houses, rumors abound of bargains with dragons, fiends, and the distant Empire of Riedra. Will the dreams of these princes lead to a new war?</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

What has allowed this order to survive when similar groups—such as the Closed Circle of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}—were destroyed is the absolute insistence that such magic should never be USED: that these words will forever remain unspoken. Unspoken mages insist that fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of progress.

This ten-story tower of red granite dominates the skyline of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Rhukaan Draal]{Rhukaan Draal}. Virtually all the hobgoblin clans have representatives at Haruuc’s court, though the Dhakaani clans maintain a particularly low profile; their agents monitor events for their lords but try not to attract attention to the activities of their clans.</p>\n<p>Guards who are stationed in Khaar Mbar'ost are heavily and well armed, wearing a signature red corded armband.</p>\n<p>Unlike ancient strongholds, such as Deneith’s Sentinel Tower, which had grown over centuries, Khaar Mbar’ost had been built all at once by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}. The passages and rooms followed an orderly plan.</p>\n<h3>The Hall of Honor</h3>\n<p>The hall of honor ran the full length of one of Khaar Mbar’ost’s upper floors.It served much the same function that gardens did in other royal palaces, giving courtiers and councilors a place to stroll and converse. The long hall had statues of famous heroes lining its walls and intricate windows of stained glass capping the distant ends. The windows showed scenes of famous battles, but the colorful panels could also pivot to allow a flow of air.</p>\n<h3>Descriptions</h3>\n<p><em>From the outside...</em></p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>Most of the buildings, old or new, that leaned in upon the narrow, unpaved streets were no more than three stories tall. A few were taller, but nothing approached a single tower that soared up in the center of the city. At first look in the setting sun the red of the tower seems to came from the light of the setting sun, but then you realize it was the stones of the structure themselves that gave it a bloody tint. The Khaar Mbar’ost, the Red House—Haruuc’s fortress. Built from red granite blocks by House Cannith. Unlike the other new buildings of the city, it seemed solidly constructed and even attractive in a vaguely sinister way. </p>\n</section>\n<p><em>The entrance courtyard...</em></p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>Massive bugbear guards, each holding a halberd as big as a flagpole and wearing red cords fastened with bronze pins in the shape of Haruuc’s sword and crown crest around their upper arms, stood straight and tall as they approached the gates of Khaar Mbar’ost. The company rode through into a hall as big as a courtyard. The unfettered noise of Rhukaan Draal vanished behind them, replaced by the controlled echoes of a fortress. From the wall opposite, an enormous relief sculpture of a hobgoblin warrior glared down at the gate, as if challenging anyone who dared to enter. Everbright lanterns ringed the hall, but its ceiling still vanished into shadow somewhere above the great sculpture’s head.</p>\n</section>\n<p><em>Haruuc's throne room...</em></p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>The throne room of Lhesh Haruuc was huge with vaulting ceilings, made larger by the deep shadows that spread up the walls to the ceiling and gathered between the pools of light shed by widely spaced everbright lanterns. Tall statues of hobgoblin warriors stood against the wall, the lanterns at their feet emphasizing the fierce faces that snarled down at those below. Between the statues hung banners with the crests of the clans of Darguun. There were easily two dozen or more of them—some large, most smaller—and for each banner there was a warlord.</p>\n<p>In front of benches, heavily carved with images of battle, that had been placed at an angle to the front of the hall, hobgoblins, some bugbears, a very few goblins, all of them dressed in robes and polished armor occupied the hall.</p>\n<p>Above the hall wrapped a balcony to seat envoyes and people of the non-goblinoid races.</p>\n<p>Benches, banners, and statues all seemed designed to focus attention on the dais at the end of the hall.

Your social standing is exceeded only by that of the nobles of the realm—and not always by them. You owe no allegiance to anyone outside the house, and it took all @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} together to put a leash on the Gorgon, the symbol of your line. Some might call you arrogant, but arrogance and self-assurance are often confused by the envious.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/cannith-mastermaker.webp\" width=\"350\" height=\"520\" /></p>\n<p>The wonders of Cannith are known throughout the world, and you feel responsible for continuing that legacy. Whether you have a dragonmark or not, you are expected to contribute to the success of your house through invention, scholarship, business, or diplomacy. Even more is expected of the dragonmarked heirs of Cannith, who serve apprenticeships in the guilds during their training, then move up into house business as their talents are honed.</p>\n<p>However, beneath your pride lurks a lingering concern. No matter where your loyalty lies, you know a house divided against itself inevitably falls, and you cannot help but feel bitterness toward those who follow these pretenders to the seat of the Gorgon. When your chosen leader takes command of the house, supporters of the would-be usurpers will be dealt with. Until then, it is up to your side to keep Cannith's glory from degenerating further.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} never shy away from combat, though they are seldom found in the thick of it. You use every tool at your disposal to ensure victory, including spells, magic items, and construct mercenaries. As a member of the house, you always have the best gear, focusing on protective or damage-dealing magic items. When Cannith goes to battle, there is no such thing as overkill.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, magic is an integral part of your surroundings. Magical training is available and strongly encouraged, but should you prove incapable of mastering the arcane arts, you will be tutored by clan elders in business, administration, and diplomacy. A career in combat or divine magic requires a strong will and demonstrable aptitude, but once you gain permission, the house will arrange training with the best tutors money can buy. For a Cannith, to do anything but excel is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>You know that continued innovation is the fortune and lifeblood of your house. Power is the ultimate goal, and any steps needed to attain it are acceptable. This is not to say that you personally embrace an ethos of immorality, but there can be no doubt that your house does. You are wise enough to pick your battles—whether physical or social—with care. Once committed, you accept nothing less than complete victory, no matter what it takes.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>The missions @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} assigns depend on your faction. In Cannith South, you might explore the Mournland or Xen'drik. Alternatively, you might travel on diplomatic missions to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{West}, playing one against the other. You could be appointed an emissary to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Morgrave University]{Morgrave University} examining new finds. You might even report to Merrix with any information you gain—or the items themselves, if possible.</p>\n<p>As a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West},, you might accompany agents of the Twelve on expeditions as far away as Argonnessen or Sarlona, representing your house. You might research ancient druid ruins in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}. You could be sent to a gala to enlighten an important noble on a matter that concerns your house. You might even find yourself engaged in espionage under cover of guild membership, traveling across Khorvaire in support of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{Jorlanna d'Cannith's} ambition to rule—or inadvertently serving the Lords of Dust as they manipulate that ambition.</p>\n<p>For @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}, you might find yourself loaned to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} in pursuit of Emerald Claw agents, meeting with Lhazaarite princes to discuss business endeavors, joining the dwarf lords of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds} to stave off an incursion from Khyber, or leading a unit of undead and constructs on a clandestine mission for the Karrnathi crown</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Gave us time to run, but I can still hear the screams.”<span class=\"author\">—Guard Brennan Ensfield,<br />Sharn Watch</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Wherever magical power can be gained, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} is nearby. Not content to let the Twelve do their work for them, the scions of the house claim any resource that might help them regain their former glory or exceed their previous achievements—as quietly as possible, of course. Though the house is not wholly evil, many within Cannith can hardly be called souls of truth and righteousness. As a base of operations for the PCs, a bastion against truly dark forces in the world, or an evil empire, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} can be a powerful force in any campaign.</p>\n<p>The last patriarch, Starrin d'Cannith, left a lasting imprint on his house. Though Merrix and Aarren created the warforged, Starrin engaged the warring sibling kings of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, persuading them both of Cannith's neutrality and of the warforged's usefulness in battle. His death was a blow from which the house has yet to recover.</p>\n<p>Instead of a single patriarch, Cannith currently has three descendants claiming the title of baron, each managing a portion of the house's concerns. Though a council of lords seneschal would typically reign over the viceroys, Merrix, Jorlanna, and Zorlan's nominal status as the heirs to the seat of the Gorgon effectively makes them a triumvirate, over which the lords seneschal have little control.</p>\n<p>Promotion within the house is judged by one's contributions to Cannith's continued growth and well-being. Members must strive if they wish to become more powerful within the hierarchy. Those who succeed are either brilliant at invention, uncannily aware of others' motives, or both. House members with no taste for politics succeed by lending their support to those so inclined.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith's} position as the nominal leader of the dragonmarked houses goes largely unchallenged. Cannith and Deneith work well together, and individuals from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} and the Twelve have an initial reaction of friendly to Cannith members. Members of the other dragonmarked houses have an initial reaction of indifferent. Notable exceptions include members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Tharashk} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{Vadalis}, both of whom dislike Cannith's questionable morals and power-hungry ways. Members of those two houses often have an initial attitude of unfriendly.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith's} HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>Though Cannith lost Whitehearth, Merrix d'Cannith's enclave in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} has taken over the house's creative work. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} enclave is the practical headquarters for the business of the house, but those with political or investment interests more often approach Jorlanna or Zorlan.</p>\n<p>Many look to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} for new wonders, but Cannith is not limited to one facility. The house has holdings across the continent, and beyond. Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} has the only current forgehold, Cannith estates are found in Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Korth, Throneport, and Trolanport, with small outposts at Regalport and Varna. Abroad, the house has holdings in Pylas Talaear on Aerenal and in Stormreach on Xen'drik. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Tinkers Guild} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Fabricators Guild} are found in every major city in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, and in larger centers in the lands beyond.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Any campaign involving the Mournland, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, Xen'drik, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} can naturally include Cannith as an ally or enemy. Cannith NPCs are proud, often bordering on arrogant. They are also practical, looking at situations— and people—from a standpoint of profit and loss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Cannith]{Organizations in House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Cannith]{People of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith as an Organization]{House Cannith as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith in the World]{House Cannith in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Cannith]{Playing a Member of House Cannith}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Makers of History]{Makers of History}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith South]{Cannith South}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith East]{Cannith East}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cannith West]{Cannith West}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-cannith-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m4fnb2ryzle","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"iNQFXyEtdULakCzU","name":"Droaam: What Defines Droaam?","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">What Defines Droaam?</h1>\n<p>While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride—driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"</p>\n<p>Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs— miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.</p>\n<p>While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist—ground meat made of troll flesh—that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder—the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.</p>\n<p>When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.</p>\n<p>Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common—and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma (Performance) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.</p>\n<p>Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.</p>\n<p>While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in muut or atcha, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms chaat'oor or gath'dar to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use aravaat—easterner—to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.</p>\n<h3>Cruel World</h3>\n<p>Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey—and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.</p>\n<p>Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.</p>\n<p>This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.</p>\n<p>While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish—for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.</p>\n<p>Every major town has a \"grist mill\"—a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate—though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily—stew, sausage, meat broth—but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew— there's plenty more where it came from!</p>\n<p>For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.</p>\n<h3>Wide Monster</h3>\n<p>It's commonly said that Eberron is \"wide magic, not high magic.\" The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society—communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster— finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Harpy Song.</strong> The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted \"songbird\" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicine. </strong>The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is \"suck it up,\" but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce troll's blood, it could revolutionize public health.</p>\n<p><strong>Brute Force.</strong> With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: What Defines Droaam?]{What Defines Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Political Structure of Droaam]{Political Structure of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Law and Order]{Law and Order}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Religion in Droaam]{Religion in Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Why Go to Droaam?]{Why Go to Droaam?}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Economy of Droaam]{Economy of Droaam}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam: Power Groups]{Power Groups}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The water flows into a pair of small lakes, each roughly half a mile across, before draining into a narrow gorge and flowing out of the forest, running all the way to the Hilt of the Dagger River. While much of the Dragonwood borders on impassable, the banks of the river are steep, but not covered with the dense undergrowth that fills much of the wood. The twin lakes are known as Glisten and Gloam in local folklore, and are charged with the magic of dreams. Wish, limited wish, miracle and similar spells have their XP costs reduced by 25% when cast from on the waters of either lake. Legends say that wishes (with or without use of the spell) made on one lake always turn back on the wisher, while those made on the other rarely take the expected form but usually turn out for the best. The tales do not clearly identify which lake is which, so those who journey there must decide where best to make their desires known.

Some twenty-six hundred years ago, a significant number of elves migrated to Khorvaire in the wake of the civil war in Aerenal that destroyed the line of Vol. Where elf and human settlements came into close proximity, intermarriage became common. However, when the earliest generations of halfelves were born, a good number of the elf settlers rejected them, leaving a population of half-caste children spread across human lands. Over the next six hundred years, this population grew.</p>\n<p>According to house doctrine, the founders of Lyrandar were chosen by the gods themselves. The half-elves Lyran and Selavash were the first to manifest the Mark of Storm, both claiming to have received their marks accompanied by visions of the sovereign lords @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arawai]{Arawai} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Kol Korran]{Kol Korran}. The sovereigns hailed the duo as the true children of Khorvaire. The half-elves were a race made strong through their hybrid blood, and would wield power over both nature and commerce.</p>\n<p>In the decades that followed, Lyran and Selavash traveled across Khorvaire, preaching their vision to others of their kind. Tales of miracles performed by the pair are common, but all that can be said for certain is that both possessed an almost supernatural ability to inspire others of their race. The charismatic duo encouraged half-elves to form their own separate communities and to recognize themselves as a unique race—the Khoravar, or \"Children of Khorvaire.\" Their followers began to call Selavash and Lyran the Firstborn, naming themselves \"children of Lyran,\" or Lyrandar.</p>\n<p>As proscribed marriage within the Khoravar community began to make Lyrandar a line of related families, the Mark of Storm spread through those families with great speed. Those blessed by this magic soon became @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}, operating a small fleet of swift ships and providing fair weather to farmers in need. Long after Selavash and Lyran had passed away, legends of the Firstborn continued to spread. To this day, a good number of Lyrandar believe that the spirits of the founders still guide the house.</p>\n<p>Like many dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar's fortunes have shifted with the end of the Last War. The Korth Edicts placed limits on the houses owning land and maintaining military forces, but with the collapse of Galifar, Lyrandar has been able to circumvent both restrictions. The house owns a number of stormships, ostensibly to defend its fleets against piracy. The house has also developed extensive holdings in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}, and appears to have considerable influence there.</p>\n<h2>The Kraken Prince</h2>\n<p>The seal of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} is a kraken surrounded by four lightning bolts, commonly attributed to one of the best-known tales of the Firstborn. In this legend, Lyran is at sea when his ship is set upon by a fleet of four reaver vessels. Lyran warns the pirates that he holds the blessing of Arawai, but they do not listen. Moments later, a kraken rises from the depths, summoning lighting to shatter the pirate vessels as Lyran's ship speeds safely on.</p>\n<p>Beyond the common legend, the less well-known doctrine of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Storm Front} claims that the Firstborn did not die but became immortal krakens, and that this is a state any Lyrandar heir can reach. According to this tale, the kraken lords remain in the depths of the sea, guiding the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Storm Front} by way of dreams and visions as they help their descendants achieve true dominance over the waves.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Organizations in House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{People of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]{House Lyrandar as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar in the World]{House Lyrandar in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]{Playing a Member of House Lyrandar}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]{Legacy of the Firstborn}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_8akcoe6m16h","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

You were raised to appreciate comfort, conversation, good drink, and hot food—not to wield a blade or smite enemies with force and fire. Do not make the easy mistake of assuming that all members of your house are good or altruistic, however. Social connections are valuable tools, and the man who is friends with the crime lord, the merchant, and the king has three powerful weapons for dealing with his enemies. You might be a charming and witty fellow who loves nothing more than a good chat—or you might be a calculating individual using your family's reputation to help you win allies who will serve you one day.</p>\n<p>As a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, you need to decide what has drawn you to adventure and away from the comforts of home. Perhaps the tales of the Wandering Inn fill you with a desire to escape the cities and test your skills in the wilds. Perhaps you intend to open an inn of your own and are adventuring to raise gold—though by the time you earn it, you might find the life of the innkeeper too dull for your tastes. You could be an enthusiastic young cook on a quest to acquire the culinary secrets of other cultures and ages. Like many Ghallanda heirs, you might adventure simply to meet useful contacts, whether in the interests of the house or for your own personal gain.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Diplomacy is the preferred weapon of your house. When words fail, a Ghallanda heir tries other tricks before resorting to combat: a swift sneak attack with a sap, paralytic poison in a drink, or an appeal to those nearby to help contain the problem. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} establishments usually have bouncers, but these guards come from no single source. A Gold Dragon Inn might be protected by defenders from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}, an ogre attached to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}, or a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains} barbarian. Many Talenta tribes owe ancient debts to your house, and they occasionally choose to repay this debt by protecting their weaker kin.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>The first step to rising in the ranks of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} is to have an interest in doing so. Most heirs are more concerned with running their own inns and restaurants than overseeing the international affairs of a dragonmarked house. Develop your conversational skills in addition to one or more Profession skills. You must learn to master your emotions, and to approach others with disarming warmth regardless of your true feelings. Agents of the house are evaluated on temperament as well as talent. Ghallanda banks on its reputation for hospitality, and an unfriendly halfling won't rise far in the house.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>As an agent of Ghallanda, you will often be asked to perform favors for house allies, thus strengthening the ties between you. On Mol, you might help a merchant deal with a band of extortionists; on Wir, you could be sent to collect rare components for an influential wizard in the local circle. It is impossible to predict what mission a particular day might bring.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Ghallanda]{Organizations in House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Ghallanda]{People of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda as an Organization]{House Ghallanda as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda in the World]{House Ghallanda in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Ghallanda]{Playing a Member of House Ghallanda}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sign of the Helpful Hound]{Sign of the Helpful Hound}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-ghallanda-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ynwg8edl1rl","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"izlRy6MXM2OKEL14","name":"Deathsgate","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Deathsgate</h1>\n<p>Officially, Deathsgate takes its name from its proximity to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Halden's Tomb]{Halden's Tomb}; a massive bridge connects the district to the necropolis, and funerary services are often held in the small temples of the district. But over the centuries, Deathsgate has become a home for those who challenge death on a daily basis—explorers, adventurers, and mercenaries of all stripes. Whether they are looking for companionship, spellcasting, or equipment, a party of adventurers should be able to find what they seek in Deathsgate. </p>\n<p>Like its counterpart in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Upper Dura]{Upper Dura}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clifftop]{Clifftop}, Deathsgate offers an exceptional range of services, but these are rarely the best the city has to offer. Many magic items are available, but the ceiling on prices keeps characters from acquiring exceptionally powerful items. However, the shops of Deathsgate are more than happy to buy or sell partially used charged items. The pawnshops generally offer 45% of value for almost any sort of goods, except those that are obviously stolen. Occasionally a fence can be found here, though usually this requires a trip to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dragoneyes]{Dragoneyes} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Dura]{Lower Dura}. </p>\n<p>While similar to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clifftop]{Clifftop} in many respects, Deathsgate has a less savory reputation. While the explorers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clifftop]{Clifftop} often seek to gain knowledge or to help people in need, Deathsgate caters to those who simply love gold or bloodshed. The people of Deathsgate are not necessarily evil—but they don't care about the moral consequences of their actions. </p>\n<p>A number of dragonmarked houses maintain outposts in Deathsgate. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} maintains a large house of healing and does a brisk trade. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} has a small enclave from which it recruits many of its Blademark warriors. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} has an office of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Speakers Guild}, including a message station, translation services, and a few barristers who specialize in the many concerns of adventurers.​</p>\n<h2>Deathsgate at a Glance</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Quarter:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tavick's Landing]{Tavick's Landing}</li>\n<li><strong>Ward:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Tavick's]{Middle Tavick's}</li>\n<li><strong>District Type: </strong>Adventurer's quarter</li>\n<li><strong>Buildings: </strong>Temples (Silver Flame, Sovereign Host), shrines (@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Olladra]{Olladra}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Mockery]{the Mockery}), average lodging (25), poor lodging (45), average food (20), poor food (60), upscale trade (3), average trades (25), poor trades (60), average services (20), poor services (60), average residences (20), poor residences (80)​</li>\n<li><strong>First Impression: </strong>People from all walks of life and all corners of Khorvaire can be found in Deathsgate.

Deathsgate Guild adventurers are mostly 2nd–5th level characters with neutral or evil alignments, and most served in the Last War. The members of Deathsgate Guild have a strong rivalry with the adventurers of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild, and Deathsgaters often start fights with their counterparts, both in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} and while out on adventures. </p>\n<p>The Deathsgate Guild enclave includes a small shrine to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Mockery]{the Mockery}, a god many of the Deathsgaters secretly revere.

This small tower seems to be formed of pure night; illusion permeates the stone, depicting a dark sky filled with stars.</p>\n<p> While some mages simply join the guild to further their arcane studies, many are willing to sell their talents. Generally, spells of up to 3rd level can be obtained at standard prices, and 4th-level spells may be available. However, there may be a 24-hour delay before a specific spell can be obtained. Members of the Guild have fewer scruples about the use of magic than their counterparts in the Esoteric Order of Aureon, and for an extra 25% of the cost, most wizards are willing to cast a spell without asking any questions.​</p>\n<h3>Karr'Aashta's Investigations</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>​Karr'Aashta</em></span> runs a small agency whose members can find out anything a client wants to know—for a price. ​<span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Karr'Aashta</em></span> has a reputation for taking on cases that the other Tharashk inquisitives won't touch, and he specializes in jobs dealing with the Cogs. However, ‘Aashta has a secret—he is a follower of the Dragon Below. The Cults of the Dragon Below are a factious bunch, and often fight one another. As a result, ‘Aashta's allegiance could help conceal the activities of a cult or lead them to the adventurers—or he could provide the adventurers with information they need to locate a cult and upset its plans, to serve the ends of his own sect.​</p>\n<h3>Redblade's</h3>\n<p>​This tavern caters to members of the Deathsgate adventurer's guild, though anyone can buy ale here.

Lian presses the Boromars just hard enough to make sure they keep up their regular payments. As a result, parties might get lucky and receive some help from the Watch when fighting Boromars. But more often than not, the Watch is nowhere to be found during major Clan operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Commander Belew Yorgan</strong> is a male dwarf who leads the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sword Point]{Sword Point} garrison in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Central]{Middle Central}. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles and wealthy patrons in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Central Plateau]{Central Plateau}, and as a result these wards are among the safest in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. But Yorgan's loyalties are first and foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever's paying the most.</li>\n<li><strong>Commander Silaena Cazal</strong> is a female elf who runs the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Warden Towers]{Warden Towers} garrison in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Middle Menthis]{Middle Menthis}. Over a century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Menthis Plateau]{Menthis Plateau}; she looks after those who pay their dues. Her mother was driven from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} when she developed an aberrant dragonmark. Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.</li>\n<li><strong>Commander Iyanna ir'Talan</strong> is a female human who commands the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Black Arch]{Black Arch} garrison in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lower Tavick's]{Lower Tavick's} Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people. If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their best hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her from getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her no friends among Sham's crime lords, and her life could be in danger despite her parentage.</li>\n<li><strong>Lady Warden Maira ir'Talan</strong>, a distant relative of the Lord Commander, leads the Blackened Book. A gifted diviner, Maira is a highly effective leader. What none know is that she's also an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Five years ago, a kalaraq quori (see chapter 6) named Tirashana implanted a mind seed in her thoughts. Maira continues to do her job while concealing any evidence of the Dreaming Dark's schemes.</li>\n<li><strong>Captain Daja Brei</strong> is a female human who commands the Guardians of the Gate. Daja firmly believes that the Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos in Sharn, and she acts with unbridled force if she believes a group or an individual threatens the city.</li>\n<li><strong>Captain Khandan Doi</strong> is a male dwarf who leads the Redcloak Battalion. Khandan is a local legend who served in the Brelish army throughout the Last War; he was knighted by the last king of Galifar and swore an oath to the first queen of Breland. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously, though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their country and its king. Because of his experiences in the war, he has a deep dislike for Thranes and followers of the Silver Flame, but he rarely lets these feelings interfere with his duties.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6l2u8fsp5zw","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Heirs of other houses lead lives of luxury, but not so the heirs of <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore\" data-id=\"tT6rqMGYUnaZygTC\"> House Tharashk</a>. As a child, you might have been stranded in the wilds or left to fend for yourself on the city streets. You would play games of hunter and prey, sometimes using real weapons. It is a harsh life, and not all heirs of the house survive it. You did, and it made you strong.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/house-tharask-with-seal.webp\" width=\"241\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>Your house is young, but what you lack in resources, you make up for in spirit. Tharashk has a destiny to fulfill, and you have a destiny in the house. Your pride is not the cultured arrogance of a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith} dandy or the blind ambition of a toothless @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} lord. It is calm assurance, based on skill and the will to succeed.</p>\n<p>You are loyal to the house as a whole, but you also have a bond to one of the three great clans within the house. The Torrn and their allies have the strongest druidic tradition and the greatest number of full-blooded orcs. The Aashta and the lesser clans bound to them produce the sorcerers of the house, and have ties to the Cults of the Dragon Below. The Velderan clan is largely human, and is known for its altruism. Torrn Tharashk are typically neutral, while the Aashta often take opportunism to dark extremes.</p>\n<h2>Tharashk Surnames</h2>\n<p>All blood heirs of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} are entitled to use d'Tharashk as a surname, or to add the d' prefix to their clan name. Tharashk heirs often ignore this custom, however—some as a sign of clan pride, others as a form of rebellion against established traditions. A Tharashk heir is just as likely to introduce himself as an Aashta or a Velderan, and people are familiar with the names of the three great clans.</p>\n<p>While Torrn, Aashta, and Velderan are the primary clans of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}, each of these three is allied with a number of smaller clans. Consider clan alliance when creating a Tharashk, but also feel free to devise your own surname for the character.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>You were taught to be self-reliant as a child, both in combat and out of it. Heirs of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} are expected to be able to handle themselves in battle, though a good hunter knows when he is outmatched by his prey. Treat battle like the hunt. Study your enemy, exploit his weaknesses, and do whatever it takes to achieve victory.</p>\n<p>As a house, Tharashk relies on the skill of its heirs and its monstrous allies to handle security. A Tharashk enclave might have minotaur guards or other exotic defenders. The enclave at Zarash'ak is protected by a trio of medusas recruited from Cazhaak Draal.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>As an heir of House Tharashk, you live for the thrill of the chase, whether hunting deadly beasts in the deep @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Reaches} or secrets in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. Though you might have no personal interest in wealth or the trouble it buys, you know that heirs who bring revenue to the house are recognized for their efforts. By helping the house acquire a rich dragonshard field in Xen'drik or forming an alliance with a tribe of lizardfolk, you receive a share of the profits—but more important, you gain the favor of those above you.</p>\n<p>For those who do wish to play the game of politics, rank within the house derives from a combination of talent, strength of will, and the courage to act. If you believe that a superior cannot perform his duties, present your evidence to a council of viceroys and call for a challenge. You can challenge only heirs of your own bloodline close to your rank, with terms set by the viceroys according to the position you are challenging. Should you call a challenge and fail, you might lose your current position in the house. At the least, you are unlikely to receive backing for any future challenges.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>As an agent of the house, you serve the interests of the viceroys and triumvir of your clan. You might be called upon to negotiate an important alliance, to investigate a likely site of dragonshards or other resources, or to track down bandits preying on house prospectors. If you have the skills of a bounty hunter, you could be asked to undertake a particular contract on behalf of the house. Once you have earned the trust of the Triumvirate, your missions turn more to increasing the power of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}—possibly by undermining the strength of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith}. If you are allied with the Torrn clan, you could be assigned to the Gatekeepers; if you are Aashta, your tasks might serve the Dragon Below.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]{Organizations in House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Tharashk]{People of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk as an Organization]{House Tharashk as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk in the World]{House Tharashk in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Tharashk]{Playing a Member of House Tharashk}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Born of Two Bloods]{Born of Two Bloods}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-tharashk-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9utyvuryl06","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Pirates harry its trade routes, and House Orien regards transport of passengers and cargo by elemental airship as encroachment on its turf. Other dragon marked houses are starting to chafe at what they perceive as House Lyrandar's arrogance and recklessness.

The duo traveled across Khorvaire, encouraging half-elves to divorce themselves from both human and elven society. Over time, the children of Selavash and Lyran—the Lyran'dar—became a dragon marked house.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War: </strong>In the early stages of the Last War, House Lyrandar was less involved than other dragonmarked houses, since its elemental airships hadn't yet been invented and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} had little need for sea transport. But as the war ground on, various governments approached House Lyrandar about using weather control to gain an advantage on the battlefield or to augment farm production at home. House Lyrandar agreed, but limited its manipulation to improving the weather. For the right price, House Lyrandar would provide plentiful spring rainfall or an early thaw in the mountains, but refused to cause a drought or bog down an army in mud or snow. Nations and dragon marked houses paid well for such services.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{Baron Esravash d'Lyrandar}: </strong>She is the youngest leader of a dragon marked house and is adored by the rank-and-file members of the Windwrights Guild in particular.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{Torval Enkiliost}:</strong> Torval leads a shadowy operation known as the Stormwalkers. </p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{Solia d'Lyrandar}: </strong>Solia is in charge of Lyrandar's affairs in Sharn. </p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Stormhome: </strong>Just off the northern coast of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair} at the mouth of Scions Sound, Stormhome is the house's largest enclave.

After the war, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} constructed several luxurious inns, making the island a popular holiday destination for the wealthy The island is more than a vacation destination, however.

Injury and illness are ghosts stalking the living, robbing them of health and youth. You have been given the ability to combat these scourges, and even to pull someone back from the brink of death. Jorasco trains you to use these skills in the service of others, but it also reminds you that everything has a price. As much as you might like to spread your healing prowess for free, you have a responsibility to keep your house healthy as well.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of curing wounds sometimes makes you reluctant to inflict them. Though you can defend yourself, you have no inclination to enter into melee without good cause. Similarly, if you find yourself attacked, you have no compunction about ending the fight as quickly as possible. You might use the dark reflection of your house's healing magic in the form of inflict spells, or seek to incapacitate foes before they can do you harm. If possible, you prefer to capture your assailants alive; if pushed, you do what you must.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Whether you found your way into Jorasco through birth, marriage, fostering, or employment, you took part in a ceremony that marked you as an accepted member of the house. This ritual varies from enclave to enclave, but typically begins with a purification ordeal involving fasting for a full day and night. The ceremony that follows involves ritual wounding and scarification, followed by healing magic and an offering to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Olladra]{Olladra}.</p>\n<p>As part of the ceremony, you made an oath of loyalty to the house, swearing to treat none but those who return the gift of healing with payment. Only in this way can the house prosper. Breaking this oath is a serious offense, and healers have been cast out of the house for doing so.</p>\n<p>Once accepted within the house, you were given an assignment in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Jorasco]{Healers Guild}. Though you might have worked for the guild in the past, your service now as a house member is mandatory. Your degree of dedication to both the healing arts and the bottom line determines how quickly you rise within the ranks of the house.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>As a Jorasco healer or heir, you are never far from the action. You might be hired to accompany a caravan, a military unit, or an expedition to any of the dangerous corners of Khorvaire. If assigned to an enclave, you might be asked to seek out the source of a new illness, to find a cure for an exotic curse afflicting a wealthy patient, or to hunt down healers who have violated their vows.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Jorasco]{Organizations in House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Jorasco]{People of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco as an Organization]{House Jorasco as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco in the World]{House Jorasco in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Jorasco]{Playing a Member of House Jorasco}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Worlds Apart]{Worlds Apart}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-jorasco-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5h9u5zh9ys4","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

The city ever was and ever will be a port, and time and tides have pushed the harbor farther and farther into the city, as neighborhoods have sunk or been washed away.</p>\n<p>The harbor is Stormreach’s lifeblood, for the city relies on trade and its status as a free port, where rules are lax as long as you have enough coin.

Thanks to the efforts of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, there's no better place to take a rest than at one of the hundreds of Gold Dragon Inns that the house operates.</p>\n<p>Every city, most towns, and even some villages have a Gold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast several. Every major road through the countryside has Gold Dragon Inns along much of its length, spaced roughly a day's travel apart. Sometimes an inn is the nucleus of a small community whose industry is focused on providing for the needs of travelers. A few Gold Dragon Inns are found in locations that offer no other comforts for the weary traveler—for example, high in a pass through the Byeshk Mountains, deep in the Karrnwood, or beneath the surface of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}.</p>\n<h3>Inn Features and Amenities</h3>\n<p>Every Gold Dragon Inn provides a standard menu of reliable services at reasonable rates. Prices are fixed (equal to those given in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook), and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable upgrades available. Every inn uses one of a small number of possible floor plans, and every inn's restaurant offers the same menu.</p>\n<p>The size and number of guest rooms can vary from inn to inn: a small roadside inn has four rooms and a moderately sized common room, while a thriving inn in a large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a separate common room, with two stages for entertainment. Because the inns are owned by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}, the buildings all include accommodations for halfling-sized guests as well as taller folk.</p>\n<p>Because travelers often carry valuables with them, each inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an arcane lock spell.

In addition to surviving the heat, the water actually seemed to be replenished by an unseen source. Curious, a dwarf priest ordered a forge set up near the pool. A skilled smith, he found that if he used the heat of the lava and then tempered his work in the cool water, his work was far better than what he was used to producing.

A temple has been built around the pool, and services to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Onatar]{Onatar} are held within. Those who seek a special blessing are allowed to dip their hands into the water, which is said to enhance their own talents.</p>\n<p>The powers of the pool may be largely legendary, but they are not completely false. Anyone who tempers a metal item using water from the pool receives a +2 bonus on the associated craft check, though the priest rarely allows anyone to take water from the pool. And if a priest or adept casts a spell from the Artifice domain within 10 feet of the pool, his effective caster level is increased by 2.​</p>\n<p>The current caretaker of the pool is actually a warforged named <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Smith</em></span>.​ ​Smith served in the Last War; along the way he developed a deep faith in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Onatar]{Onatar}, who he believes guided humanity to create the warforged race. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Smith</em></span> believes that the god has a plan for the warforged, and he has done his best to get other members of the warforged community to embrace his vision. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Smith</em></span> is deeply opposed the violent ideology of the Lord of Blades, and firmly believes that the warforged and the creatures of flesh are meant to live together.​​</p>\n<h3>The Red Hammer</h3>\n<p>This unusual business is an inn—for warforged. Warforged do not need to eat, drink, or sleep, but they can still hunger for camaraderie. The Red Hammer is a place for warforged to gather, make new friends, and exchange stories. The Hammer is owned by two warforged, <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Blue </em></span>and <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Crucible</em></span>.

{"_id":"lKmno9yHyP3vmIKZ","name":"Lorghalen","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Lorghalen</h1>\n<p>Two years after the founding of Zilargo, a pamphlet was distributed explaining the existence of the Trust and the role that it would play in the nation moving forward. This tract concluded with the words <em>To those who follow the proper path, we shall be as invisible as any ghost. Trust that we have your best interests at heart. Trust that we will act only when we must. Trust that we will always look after the needs of our great family, and that we need your aid as much as you need ours</em>. Today, the Trust is universally accepted as part of Zilargo, and it's estimated that at least a third of the population works for the Trust in some capacity. But despite what the Triumvirate would have you think, not all of the early Zil embraced the Trust with open arms. Some demanded accountability, insisting that this Trust be drawn into the light. Others called it a coup, urging their families to end the experiment of Zilargo and return to their prior independence. But few spoke out against the Trust for long; deadly accidents and unlikely misfortune quickly stilled to voices that challenged this new order. It seemed it was too late for those who opposed the Trust to remove it from their nation… And so, most chose to remove themselves, leaving their new nation behind.</p>\n<p>Many of these dissidents immigrated into the Five Nations, and most who did so abandoned their old ways and fully embraced their new nations. A simple indicator of this is name. Zil gnomes use three names: A personal name, family name, and house name. Alina Lorridan Lyrris is <em>Alina of the Lorridan family in House Lyrris.</em> Even if they have distant blood connections to a Zil family, a gnome with no direct ties to Zilargo won't be part of a Zil house. So if the gnome sage you meet in Aundair calls herself Talia Lorridan Lyrris, you know she considers herself Zil; if she's just Talia Lorridan, she's likely Aundairian.</p>\n<p>Other dissidents had grander aspirations and took to the sea. The gnomes had long been accomplished sailors, and while they never had a colonizing spirit, they'd explored the coasts and made note of interesting and unclaimed lands. Now these sailors dreamt of creating their own new havens, whose glories might one day outshine the land they left behind. Sadly, most of these rebel colonies came to bad ends. <strong>Tolanen</strong> was located on the Shadow Marches; some years after its founding, a trading vessel docked to find the town completely depopulated. While the travelers blamed pillaging orcs, accounts later confirmed that there were no signs of conflict—and that the only looting was committed by the merchants themselves. <strong>New Zalanberg</strong> was established on the coast of Xen'drik, near the modern settlement of Zantashk. Over the course of decades, it prospered and grew. And then, within the span of a week, its people tore the town and one another to pieces—one of the notable examples of what has come to be recognized as the <em>Du'rashka Tul</em>. There were a handful of others, but only one still thrives to this day: the principality of <strong>Lorghalen</strong>. </p>\n<p>Exploring the island, the gnomes found that it was poised on the edge of Lamannia. The land was bountiful, fresh water was plentiful, and much of the island was <em>alive</em>. Lorghalen has the most intense concentration of elementals found beyond the wild zones of Sarlona. Stones roll of their own accord. The earth rumbles. What seems to be a peaceful pond might unexpectedly move to a new location. Most of the elementals of Lorghalen are spirits of earth and water, but there are storms that follow paths of their own choosing and pits of endless fire. These elementals are creatures of Lamannia, pure and inhuman; there are no dao or marids here. There are also a number of megafauna beasts in the deep jungle; sailors may occasionally spot rocs hunting whales off the coast of Lorghalen. This is why the island had never been colonized in the past; what city could survive the ravages of an avalanche of earth elementals? But the colonists came prepared. The leaders of the expedition had long studied elementals, convinced that it was possible to reason with these alien creatures. Using these techniques they were able to secure the region around Cornerstone. Over the course of generations, the Lorghalen gnomes developed and honed these techniques, learning how to live in harmony with the elementals and even to convince the spirits and beasts of the land to work with them. This lifestyle has consequences. Cornerstone is the only large city on the island; other gnomes live in family estates along the coast, or on the edge of the jungle. But the deep jungles of Lorghalen are left to the primal forces. The gnomes know what they can harvest without upsetting the balance, but they are careful not to push these limits.</p>\n<p>After a few minor clashes in the region, the Lorghalen gnomes were recognized as one of the Lhazaar Principalities. Their small fleet primarily focuses on merchant trade within the Principalities. There are many unusual plants in the jungles of Lorghalen, and the Lorghali produce medicines, drugs, and potent spirits. The wood of Lorghalen is exceptionally strong, rivaling the densewood and bronzewood of Aerenal; the Lorghali don't export lumber, but they sell fine wooden goods. While there are relatively few ships in the Lorghalen fleet, Lhazaar tread lightly around a Lorghali vessel; not only are the hulls of their ships exceptionally strong, but most vessels are accompanied by one or more water elementals. These friendly spirits help propel the vessel, allowing Lorghalen ships to match the capabilities of Lyrandar elemental galleons. In battle, Lorghalen ships are known for launching small earth elementals at opposing ships, stone missiles that continue to wreak havoc after impact. All together, the Lorghalen gnomes are known and respected within the Principalities, but are largely unknown beyond it. For the most part they do their trading within the islands, allowing others to carry their goods to distant lands. </p>\n<h2>WHO ARE THE GNOMES OF LORGHALEN?</h2>\n<p>The gnomes of Lorghalen and share some traits with their Zil cousins. They love clever oratory and prefer to solve their problems with words instead of swords. But where the gnomes of Zilargo dive deep into intrigue, the founders of Lorghalen based their society on principles of <em>freedom</em> and <em>honesty</em>. The founders of Cornerstone swore that there would be no secrets on their island: that all knowledge should be shared, and all problems drawn into the light, not removed in the shadows. Ties to previous Zil houses were dissolved, and all gnomes of the island consider themselves to be one house; so a gnome of the island might introduce themselves as <em>Tara Tan Lorghalen</em>.</p>\n<p>Families are still important to the Lorghalen gnomes, and each family maintains an estate—a farming village based around a central long house. Each family is known for specific crops and skills, and Cornerstone is where they all come together. While families maintain funds for dealing with the world beyond Lorghalen, on the island the economy is largely driven by barter and the exchange of favors. All of the families have lodging in Cornerstone, and each family has three representatives on the Cornerstone Council, which governs the island and mediates disputes. The council is led by the Prince of Lorghalen, but this is an unusual position with less power than in other principalities. The Prince of Lorghalen is recognized as the cleverest gnome on the island, and as such someone whose voice should always be heard and opinion considered. But they have no power beyond that. Any Lorghali can claim the title by defeating the current prince in a series of duels of wit and strategy. Sometimes decades go by with no challenges; at other times, challenges have been a weekly or daily occurrence. </p>\n<p>Overall, the gnomes of Lorghalen have little interest in dealing with the outside world. They consider it to be a dangerous place driven by greed and dishonesty. However, some are drawn beyond the island by sheer curiosity, others by the challenge of matching wits with a dangerous world, and some by a need to obtain resources or techniques unavailable on Lorghalen. Most strive to remain true to the principles of their culture even in hostile lands, solving problems through open discussion rather than treachery and subterfuge. They aren't fools; a Lorghalen gnome won't spill every secret to a stranger, and even is a gnome doesn't want to lie, they don't have to say anything at all. But they prefer Persuasion to Deception—believing that they can <em>convince</em> an enemy of the proper path. Intimidation is also an acceptable tool, but this is largely a matter of <em>tone</em>—not making ideal threats, but rather making sure an enemy understands just how dangerous the wrong decision could be.</p>\n<p>Gnomes make up the vast majority of the population of the island, though there are a few others who have immigrated over the years. Because of the dangers posed by the Hammer, usually the only way to reach Cornerstone is on a Lorghalen ship. The Lorghali are largely gracious hosts and curious gnomes are often eager to talk to outsiders, but the gnomes are aware that outsiders don't share their traditions of honesty and watch strangers with both eyes. In particular, over the last century a number of Zil have reached out to Lorghalen. The islanders are especially suspicious of their cousins and do not trust the Trust, but there has been a little cultural exchange; notably, a fascination with the Lorghalen stonesinging techniques led to the rise of the Power of Purity movement in Zilargo. </p>\n<h2>Dragonmarked Houses on Lorghalen</h2>\n<p>They don't have a significant presence on the island. I'd rather explore the story of the houses <em>taking</em> an interest in Lorghalen and actively trying to expand their presence there rather than have it be established. So there's no Orien outpost or Lyrandar docking tower in Cornerstone. I might give them a Gold Dragon Inn that's <em>just opened</em> in the wake of the Treaty of Thronehold. It could also be interesting to have a Sivis outpost that's recently established and working with Lorghali foundlings with the Mark of Scribing. House Sivis would certainly be interested in tapping a new supply of heirs—but the Council of Cornerstone is suspicious of Sivis and anything that could give the Trust a foothold on their island.</p>\n<h2>The Religion of Lorghalen</h2>\n<p>The Lorghali follow a tradition of concrete animism. They live in a land that is literally alive with spirits; they refer to the lands beyond the island as “Deadlands” because of this, finding it depressing to wander in realms where the wind and waves aren't singing back to them. There are a number of exceptionally powerful entities, including elementals like the Hammer and legendary megafauna beasts. So the Lorghali don't believe in distant, abstract deities; instead, they focus on concrete, local spirits. They respect nature, but in a much more CONCRETE way that a druid who reveres Eberron as a whole; they have a personal relationship with the well that provides their water and the boulder that roles by every day, and they likely have festivals in which the greater spirits are invoked. But this isn't about FAITH, it's a practical, concrete relationship—which is why they tend toward primal magic as opposed to divine.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_g0qv2btwy4s","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"lLU7mKtbu3y5HEyS","name":"Droaam: Economy of Droaam","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Economy of Droaam</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth—so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage—\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"—adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam—or is perhaps even an ally—there won't be a bounty on its teeth.</p>\n<p>While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter—any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.</p>\n<p>Droaam's main exports—brokered through @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}— are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall]{Graywall} marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!</p>\n<p>In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore-tables.Droaamish Artisanship]{Droaamish Artisanship} table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}.

{"_id":"lVOXsL7AEU1wyVeu","name":"Shavarath","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Shavarath</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Eternal Battleground</h2>\n<p>In Shavarath, angels and devils are locked in endless conflict. Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky. In another layer, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. There’s only one constant in Shavarath: war.</p>\n<p>The war in Shavarath began at the moment of creation, and it will continue to the end of time. Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, “Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something—anything—else?” In particular, it’s common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, “Why don’t you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!”</p>\n<p>The angel isn’t fighting for a single nation, and this war isn’t driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarath believe that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory—every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram—strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.</p>\n<p>So to an angel, the destruction of a human city—or an entire nation—is trivial. Mortals will die; that’s their most defining trait. Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today’s mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn’t held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.</p>\n<p>If you’re a hero, you might look to the angel and say, “What can I do to help? Can we fight at your side?” To which the angel simply smiles and responds, “You already are.” Just as every mortal dreams in Dal Quor and has a shadow in Mabar, there’s a sliver of every mortal soul that fights in Shavarath. The skill and power of these conscripts reflect your own courage and will . . . and just like the angels, this sliver of yours can survive a thousand deaths. So it’s not your place to fight on the battlefields of Shavarath. You do your part by living your life, by fighting for the principles you believe in wherever you may be.</p>\n<p>There is war in Shavarath, and there will always be war in Shavarath. It can’t be won, and it can’t be abandoned. As a mortal in Shavarath, your primary goal should always be to survive—because in Shavarath, there are a million ways to die.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>There’s a part of you that’s always been in Shavarath, a sliver of your soul that’s always been at war. When you’re in Shavarath, those instincts guide you. It’s easier to strike a deadly blow, or to grit your teeth and fight on through pain or injury.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/shavarath-symbol.webp\" width=\"308\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>War Magic.</strong> When a creature casts a spell that grants a bonus to AC, attack rolls, or saving throws, or a spell that grants temporary hit points, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Unquenchable Fury.</strong> A creature has advantage on saving throws against any spells or abilities that charm a target, as well as against the calm emotions and sanctuary spells. In addition, the duration of these effects are halved, to a minimum duration of 1 round. While a barbarian is raging, its rage can’t be ended early unless it’s knocked unconscious.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight On.</strong> On a creature’s turn, it can use a bonus action to spend 1 Hit Die. It rolls the die and adds its Constitution modifier, regaining hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Once a creature benefits from this property, it must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodletting. </strong>When a creature scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, it can roll one of the attack’s damage dice one extra time and add it to the extra dice of the critical hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Time. </strong>Time’s passage varies between Shavarath’s layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the Burning Sky, an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of Nullius Terram and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron. A creature with proficiency in Arcana can determine the passage of time in their layer by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few ways Shavarath can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>ManifeST ZoneS</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Shavarath often inspire people to violence and aggression, and can convey any of the plane’s universal properties. These zones can be dangerous places to dwell, but can also encourage martial discipline and enhance training. While many of the greatest weapons in Shavarath can’t be removed from the plane, manifest zones tied to Shavarath can often provide inspiration for artificers and smiths, and it may be possible to craft deadly enchantments in a Shavaran manifest zone that simply aren’t possible beyond it.</p>\n<p>Manifest zones rarely act as gateways to Shavarath, but anything is possible when Shavarath is coterminous.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>When Shavarath is coterminous, people are quick to anger and must be careful to not fight over trivial things. Angry words are more likely to produce brawls, and restless thought to lead to riots or revolutions. The plane’s War Magic and Unquenchable Fury properties spread worldwide while it’s coterminous, encouraging violence. Meanwhile, in Shavaran manifest zones, outbreaks of intense violence can draw whirling blades into the zone, slaughtering people on all sides.</p>\n<p>Shavarath is traditionally coterminous for 1 year every 36 years. Throughout history, some military leaders have plotted campaigns around this, while peaceful communities plan ahead to contain violence. In addition to its regular cycle, Shavarath frequently grows coterminous for a single day; predicting these periods was critical for battle strategy during the Last War. Shavarath is traditionally remote for a year every 36 years, which prevents the occasional single-day coterminous spikes, but otherwise has no apparent effect on the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>shavaran artifaCts</h3>\n<p>Unlike Fernian elementals, the immortals of Shavarath don’t create their weapons and tools of war; they’re shaped by the plane itself. Many of the grandest weapons—explosives that can level cities, airships the size of small towns—either can’t be removed from Shavarath or wouldn’t function elsewhere.

{"_id":"lbnHxrWFwfpbsQOM","name":"Layers of Lamannia","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Layers of Lamannia</h1>\n<p>Each of Lamannia’s layers highlights a particular aspect of primal nature. One layer in Lamannia might contain a single colossal mountain peak; on the other hand, the Twilight Forest could be as large as Khorvaire (or even Eberron itself). The edge of a layer could be an impassable physical barrier, or it could wrap around onto itself—if you sail far enough in the Endless Ocean, you’ll find yourself back where you began. Most layers of Lamannia follow a traditional day-night cycle, though they aren’t synchronized across layers, and when the moon Olarune is visible, it’s always full.</p>\n<p>The portals that connect the layers of Lamannia often only allow travel in one direction. Any deep pool of water may connect a layer to the Endless Ocean; but while you can get to the Ocean by diving into a pond in the Twilight Forest, there’s no gate back to the forest on the other side. The Endless Ocean contains small islands, and if you explore one, you’ll find you’ve moved to a new layer.</p>\n<p>The following are just a handful of Lamannia’s many layers. In creating a layer, think of a distinctive natural feature—a canyon, a desert, a lone mountain—and build the layer around it. What creatures would be found there? Have any outsiders taken up residence? Is there an unusual role for elementals? How does it connect to other layers or Eberron?</p>\n<h2>the twiLiGht Forest</h2>\n<p>The sky is hidden by the dense canopy of this vast rainforest, leaving the forest floor in an endless twilight. The trees are over a hundred feet in height—impressive, certainly, though not as tall as the greatpines of the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches. But as people further explore the Twilight Forest, they come upon strange ridges and walls of wood, some forming twisted wooden canyons. Following these, explorers discover they’re the roots of unimaginably colossal trees, vast titans wider and taller than the towers of Sharn. The Twilight Forest as mortals experience it lies in the shadow of the grander canopy that rises far above it, and these enormous trees are home to megafauna and mightier beings.</p>\n<p>Though the Twilight Forest is wild and untamed, explorers can find wide cleared paths through the lower forest. Survival experts may recognize that these aren’t trails created by humanoid hands; rather, they’re the paths of totems, who have crushed the lesser forest beneath their colossal feet. The forest is filled with beasts—mundane and dire creatures in the lower forests, megafauna in the grand canopy above it, and the occasional passage of totems. There are multiple communities of lycanthropes scattered throughout the lower forest. A clan of wererats have carved out a warren in the roots of a colossal tree, while a pack of wild wereboars feuds with werewolves descended from exiled templars. An ancient elf druid named Haral, who spends most of her time in the form of an owl, does her best to maintain order; she is assisted in this by a megafauna owl she calls Ruark.</p>\n<p>The forest has many other inhabitants, and a few minor elementals can be found in this layer. A gust of wind, a pool of water, a rolling stone—in Lamannia, any of these things could be alive.</p>\n<h2>The Broken Land</h2>\n<p>The Broken Land is a volcanic region filled with high mountains and lava plains. There are constant eruptions, and the layer is home to many fire and earth elementals that engage in an ongoing environmental conflict. Fire elementals flow out with the lava as volcanoes erupt; earth elementals work to contain the eruptions and to rebuild the shattered peaks, only to have them erupt again. Few beasts manage to thrive in this layer, but some tough dinosaurs have clawed out a niche. While this region has fewer connections to Eberron than the Twilight Forest, it’s also possible to find remnants of other travelers here; it’s a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded adventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.</p>\n<h2>The endLess ocean</h2>\n<p>This layer reflects the majesty of the ocean depths. It’s home to a vast array of fish and aquatic beasts, along with merfolk tribes and a wide range of water elementals, from simple sentient currents and weirds to massive leviathans and battling megafauna. The Endless Ocean is where the gnome Tasker encountered an island that turned out to be a totem turtle. True islands are few and far between, and most are actually portals to other layers of Lamannia. There are many points in the Endless Ocean tied to manifest zones (most located in ocean depths) in the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>The FirsT sTorm</h2>\n<p>A layer of plains and low hills, this region is permanently lashed by hurricane winds and endless storms. Beasts huddle in caves and the limited shelter, while all manner of elementals clash in the storm-lashed plains. A massive elder tempest drives the heart of the storm; during the Sundering of Sarlona, an apocalyptic cult in Ohr Kaluun sought to bring this elemental to Eberron, believing it would destroy the world.</p>\n<h2>The roT</h2>\n<p>Decay is part of nature, and this is reflected in the swamp-like Rot, a relatively small layer filled with fallen, rotting trees. Corpses of megafauna beasts lie scattered around the layer, and giant insects and other massive scavengers prey on their remains. There’s a community of wererats thriving in the Rot, and there could be a small outpost of the Children of Winter who found their way here. While the Rot is a symbol of death and decay, it’s entirely natural, and undead have no place here. It’s possible a necromancer could arrive here, hoping to animate the massive corpses; however, this would violate the theme of the plane, and if there’s any higher power at work in Lamannia, it would certainly direct forces to counter this. While most layers of Lamannia are free from disease, disease itself is part of nature; a manifest zone tied to the Rot could spread plagues into the surrounding region.</p>\n<h2>TiTan’s Folly</h2>\n<p>Lamannia is filled with precious natural resources; it’s hardly surprising that an advanced civilization would try to harvest them. During the Age of Giants, the Group of Eleven set up a research station and mining camp in a layer of Lamannia. After a decade struggling against megafauna attacks and elemental-enhanced weather, the outpost was finally overwhelmed and abandoned. It’s a testament to the arcane engineering of the giants that anything remains of this structure . . . although it may be that it remains because the ruin itself has become a symbol of nature reclaiming civilization. Vines and moss cover shattered walls, and the bones of giants are scattered throughout the remnants of this garrison. Valuable and powerful treasures may well be hidden in the Folly, but explorers will have to contend with aggressive elementals, dangerous beasts, and traps left by the long-dead giants themselves.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/lamannia-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6q5tcslkt0e","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

Through its Banking Guild, Kundarak endorses loans (typically at 10% interest per year, plus a collateral requirement of the DM's choice) and letters of credit, in addition to providing safekeeping for some of Khorvaire's most valuable treasures. The Warding Guild boasts experts in defenses both magical and mundane.</p>\n<h2>The Banking Guild</h2>\n<p>The interest that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} charges for loans is responsible for the lion's share of the house's income. Its banks can be found in cities across the Five Nations and eastern Khorvaire— all magically warded and watched over by house guards. The Banking Guild regulates commerce in gem cutting and jewelry manufacture, money changing, and moneylending. It also advises (some would say dictates to) national governments about consistent standards for coinage. It works closely with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} on accounting matters and with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} on price stability for basic goods.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak's} vaults are magically linked across Khorvaire and even to the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik. A customer who rents a safe-deposit vault can access that vault from any Kundarak bank.</p>\n<h2>The Warding Guild</h2>\n<p>If the Banking Guild is the public face of Kundarak, then the Warding Guild is its quiet twin. The guild provides a wide array of services relating to security and protection. This guild is best known as the licensing authority for locksmiths, but it also includes magical warders and some security guards. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} have a tacit agreement: Guarding things is the domain of House Kundarak, and guarding people is that of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith}.</p>\n<h2>Golden Door</h2>\n<p>This division of the Warding Guild is responsible for elaborate security devices, such as complex locks and magic wards. Affordable only by the very rich, most of its work is performed on behalf of Kundarak itself or other dragon marked houses.</p>\n<h2>Iron Gate</h2>\n<p>Also part of the Warding Guild, the Iron Gate supplies guards to augment the security devices of the Golden Door. Members of the Iron Gate keep a low profile and are rarely seen beyond the locations they guard. Although they avoid taking jobs for which @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith's} Defenders Guild is better suited, they do provide bodyguards for most of the important clan lords of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}.</p>\n<h2>Ghorad'din</h2>\n<p>This shadowy group of sneaks and assassins is little known beyond the membership of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}. Answering only to Lord Morrikan and his six hereditary chieftains, members of the Ghorad'din are expert at bypassing security—even House Kundarak's security—and at a variety of assassination techniques.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Kundarak]{Organizations in House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Kundarak]{People of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak as an Organization]{House Kundarak as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak in the World]{House Kundarak in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Kundarak]{Playing a Member of House Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wardens of the Gates]{Wardens of the Gates}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-kundarak-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_cx94dsdsky8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Fathen exposed scores of lycanthropes in Sharn, but on 25 Barrakas a pack of wererats tore him limb from limb on the streets of North Market.

If travel is important in a campaign, little work needs to be done to bring Orien into it. Whether a journey by caravan or lightning rail is simply a means to get to adventure or an adventure in and of itself, the PCs will become familiar with (if not employed by) @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} before they reach their destination.</p>\n<p>Orien caravans are the cheapest and often most dependable means of travel for adventurers. Even those with the wealth to afford the lightning rail or airship travel soon discover many destinations in Khorvaire that only caravans or coaches can reach.</p>\n<p>Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} follows the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses, significant differences exist at the top levels. On the patriarch's council, each guild has three representatives (two elected by guild members, one appointed by the guildmaster) while the house has another three representatives appointed by the patriarch. Protocol is firmly followed at the higher levels. Decisions are rarely made without a quorum present, and a two-thirds majority vote is required for most resolutions. The patriarch almost never makes a decision alone, but presents issues to his council and casts the deciding vote when necessary. It is no surprise, then, that the other houses look at Orien and wonder who is in charge.</p>\n<p>Among the middle to lower ranks of the house, the full acceptance of children born out of wedlock (and halfbreed children at that) throws a twist into the traditional dragonmarked sense of aristocracy. Birth order and blood ties to the house are the primary determination of social status. Within the guilds, more upward mobility is possible, since family ties are less important.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Orien's part in making travel accessible to the population as a whole, most common folk have an initial attitude of indifferent or friendly to members of the house. Citizens of Passage (where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien][House Orien} wields considerable power) have an initial reaction of friendly or helpful. Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} have an initial reaction of friendly to members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}, thanks to the long-standing relationship between their operations.</p>\n<h2>House Orien'S HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The families that made up @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} were originally spread across Aundair, but their transformation into a dragonmarked house created the need for a home. They chose a small town that they renamed Passage, building their main enclave and headquarters there. This they called \"Journey's Home,\" in reference to the amount of time most house heirs would be away from it.</p>\n<p>Journey's Home takes up roughly one-third of the modern city of Passage. It employs nearly half the city's workforce in one capacity or another, with a considerable number devoted to the construction and maintenance of lightning rail carts and caravan wagons. Research into new magical methods of transport and shipping is centered at Journey's Home, and most spellcasting heirs make their homes there.</p>\n<p>All members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} are expected to spend time at Journey's Home, learning the behindthe-scenes aspects of running the house and guilds as they keep up with the industry Orien has created. Guild hirelings might visit on occasion, but such trips are rare, and usually presage advancement or individual honor.</p>\n<p>In addition to Journey's Home, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} keeps enclaves in Sharn, New Cyre, Varna, Korth, Regalport, Krona Peak, Flamekeep, Taer Valaestas, and Trolanport. The house also has outposts and offices in nearly every town on the trade roads and lightning rail routes of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and beyond. Most of these offer the services of one or both guilds. Aside from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis}, Orien is the only dragonmarked house to have a significant presence in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} maintains a number of lightning rail coaches that act as mobile enclaves for important house members. Used exclusively for house and guild business, these coaches are not held to any timetable, and are given priority on the lightning rail lines over commercial and private coaches alike.</p>\n<h2>House Orien IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Any campaign that requires travel across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} is a perfect candidate for the inclusion of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien][House Orien}. Unlike other houses with their overarching plots and politics, Orien's focus is simply getting from point A to point B—preferably with everyone alive, still in possession of what they left home with, and having paid their fares. The challenges involved in maintaining this status quo are sufficient that Orien has little time for intrigue, except when the schemes of others interfere with the house's plans.</p>\n<p>NPCs in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien} are pragmatic and resultsoriented. All the lofty intentions in the world amount to nothing if you cannot make the coaches run on time. Orien is a service industry, and its members have mastered the art of keeping a pleasant, calm expression in the midst of chaos. All members of the house are family, regardless of where they come from. Anyone outside the house is a potential customer, and Orien ever forgets that.</p>\n<h2>House Orien Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Organizations in House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]{House Orien as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Orien]{People of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien in the World]{House Orien in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Orien]{Playing a Member of House Orien}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.By Road and Rail]{By Road and Rail}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_wcf9z2v1mgb","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"nW5Cz22rtkGaSlyL","name":"Clan Tordannon","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Clan Tordannon</h1>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<p><strong>Capital:</strong> Frosthaven<br /><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Copper, medicinal supplies, livestock<br /><strong>Enemies:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Droranath]{Droranath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Narathun}<br /><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Empathy, generosity, loyalty. Always willing to help a friend in need, and always willing to make a new friend.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Like Lanarak and Londurak, the mythic founders of Clans Toldorath and Tordannon were siblings. Unlike their fellow exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both. Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They’re stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans—to family, clan, and the holds themselves.</p>\n<p>But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash’tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy—the modern Jhorash’tar aren’t particularly adept healers—but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash’tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.</p>\n<p>Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and fighters, hunters and rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it’s always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Moving further in, you find the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. There are dozens of layers in Irian, and each one is a vision of life triumphant. Irian is the dawn that inevitably banishes even the darkest night, the promise of spring triumphing over the coldest winter. It’s the bastion of hope, the promise that life always find a way.</p>\n<p>In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran calls Irian the Plane of Light, and indeed, its light is so prevalent that there’s no full darkness within Irian. But it’s also the plane of life, the source of positive energy, the force that sustains life and underlies most healing magic.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/irian-symbol.webp\" width=\"241\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Radiant Power. </strong>When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, it’s treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.</p>\n<p><strong>Necrotic Void. </strong>In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure Light. </strong>There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Triumphant. </strong>Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.</p>\n<p><strong>The Light of Life.</strong> The light of Irian restores vitality, granting the following benefits to all living creatures. These have no effect on undead or constructs; however, undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal, benefit from these effects as if they were living creatures.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a living creature with at least 1 hit point regains 3 (1d6) hit points.</li>\n<li>A living creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn.</li>\n<li>A living creature has resistance to poison damage.</li>\n<li>A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Standard Time.</strong> Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways Irian can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Irian are wellsprings of positive energy. Plants and animals thrive in these zones, while people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy. Irian zones often have one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Irian zones with the Radiant Power property support spells of healing and may enable rituals or support eldritch machines that can’t be built anywhere else. In particular, the City of the Dead in Aerenal is built on a strong Irian manifest zone, which sustains the deathless councilors.</p>\n<p>Irian zones rarely extend the full swift healing effect of Irian’s Light of Life property. However, all of the following benefits are common when in an Irian zone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks.</li>\n<li>Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, use the highest number possible for each die.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all these reasons, Irian manifest zones are a valuable natural resource, and often become the foundations of villages, towns, or Jorasco healing houses. Irian manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, and traveling to Irian usually requires plane shift or similar magic.</p>\n<h3>CoterMinous and reMote</h3>\n<p>Life blossoms when Irian is coterminous. Health and fertility are enhanced, positive energy flows freely, and living creatures are infused with an abundant sense of hope. While Irian is coterminous, the Radiant Power property applies across Eberron and all creatures have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.</p>\n<p>When Irian is remote, colors seem to fade and a sense of psychic numbness pervades the world. All creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and resistance to radiant damage. In addition, any effect that restores hit points—including spells and spending Hit Dice—only restores half the usual amount. However, creatures still regain full hit points after completing a long rest.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Irian is coterminous for ten days in the month of Eyre and remote for ten days in the month of Sypheros. These effects occur once every three years; the remote cycle comes a year and a half after it is coterminous.</p>\n<h3>IrIan artIfacts</h3>\n<p>The Aereni harness Irian’s energy, using it to create many of their tools, but industry isn’t one of the core concepts of Irian and relics from the plane itself are relatively rare. Whether from the plane itself or simply drawing on its power, items tie to the effects of positive energy: healing, dealing radiant damage, generating light, bringing hope, or overcoming fear. A scroll that provides a single trip to the Refuge would be an invaluable boon.</p>\n<p>Plants that grow in Irian manifest zones can often have remarkable properties. Many of of Aerenal’s exotic lumbers— notably livewood—only grow in Irian zones. Araam’s crown is a flower with remarkable medicinal properties; House Jorasco requires a steady supply of it for their healing potions. Another flower, dawn’s glory, has euphoric properties and is used to make a drug often called fool’s hope or liquid courage. This drug grants temporary immunity to fear, but with the side effect of encouraging dangerous and foolhardy behavior; it’s strictly illegal in Sharn, due to the risk of users jumping off bridges.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/irian-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_xk1f6b5hes","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

Membership in the Handlers Guild is not mandatory for all house members, but for heirs who intend to work outside the main enclaves, the guild establishes a good working relationship with ranchers and other breeders.</p>\n<p>In the same way, membership in the Handlers Guild is not automatically a stepping-stone to status in the house. Both guild and house are vital in their own right, and joining one solely to make progress in the other is actively discouraged.</p>\n<h2>Handlers Guild</h2>\n<p>The Handlers Guild is a mercantile guild under the control of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis}. Unlike the dragonmarked houses in which guilds control industry while the house handles administrative tasks, Vadalis divides responsibilities in a different fashion.</p>\n<p>The house handles research into new types of animals and new breeding programs, as well as the sale, care, and training of those animals. The Handlers Guild functions much as an outreach program, operating primarily in areas where Vadalis does not have official house enclaves. The guild serves to gather independent ranchers and breeders, share information and bloodlines, and sell Vadalis methods and training to those who want to improve their own herds through nonmagical means. In addition, the guild licenses the teamsters, drovers, stablehands, and handlers that comprise the most common face of the house in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Handlers Guild provides certification for its members, allowing them to find work with wealthy patrons who need their lands and livestock managed. It also deals with business the house does outside the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}. It has almost no enclaves or outposts, its members instead meeting up wherever their travels happen to take them. Some have noted that such a fluid presence would make an excellent front for any number of sinister causes, but no evidence of such activity in Vadalis has ever been found.</p>\n<h2>Balinor's Blessed</h2>\n<p>These dragon marked hunters specialize in the live capture of exotic animals. Balinor's Blessed bring griffons' eggs and live displacer beasts back to the ranches, and when some new and interesting beast is discovered, it is the Blessed who are sent to investigate. A PC who is a member of the Blessed could have many adventures tied to the capture of such marvelous creatures.</p>\n<h2>The Feral Heart</h2>\n<p>This is the dark shadow hidden within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis}. The magebreeders of the Feral Heart seek to unleash the full potential of the natural world—no matter how horrific. They have been uncovering the forbidden techniques of the Seryan line, and even searching for the tools of the daelkyr in hopes of creating living weapons of war. The Dragon Below cultist Mazina is secretly using the Heart as a cover to bring fiendish spirits into the world. Will PCs who fight the beasts of the Feral Heart discover the secrets of their makers?</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{House Vadalis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Vadalis]{Organizations in House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis as an Organization]{House Vadalis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Vadalis]{People of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis in the World]{House Vadalis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Vadalis]{Playing a Member of House Vadalis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Family Business]{Family Business}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-vadalis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_aox13eajy0c","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Offer sound advice and protect your friends from harm.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The mythic founder of House Kundarak was a stonemason who built the first shelter for the exiles. While House Sivis estimates that Kundarak’s dragonmark appeared less than three thousand years ago, in the stories, Kundarak had always borne the mark and used its powers to protect their people. Dwarves of all clans relied on Kundarak, both for wise counsel and their expertise in building. Kundarak laid the foundations of the fortresses that stood against the armies of Galifar.</p>\n<p>But soon after Bal Dulor, Clan Kundarak became House Kundarak, expanding its influence across Khorvaire. While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans—House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak’s new role—though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.</p>\n<p>House Kundarak has no seat on the Iron Council and is not considered a Mror clan. Kundarak has done its best to stay out of the War Below, though Kundarak engineers played an important part in building defenses during the War Below, and were well paid for their services. Despite the lure of treasures and the mysteries of the past, Kundarak has no interest in courting disaster beneath the very seat of its power; it has fortified all deep portals beneath its spires. Should it choose to send expeditions below, it would do so with extreme care and caution.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

It runs most of the theaters, music halls, circuses (including the traveling Carnival of Shadows), and similar establishments in Khorvaire. Any business associated with the guild (theaters, music halls, circuses, and so on) only employs licensed talent. A character who has at least a d8 in an associated skill can earn a place with one of the bound businesses of the house. A character with such credentials can find employment in any major city of Khorvaire. Phiarlan heirs are among the finest performers in the world, but anyone can be licensed who meets the guild's standards and pays its annual fee.</p>\n<h2>THE SERPENTINE TABLE</h2>\n<p>The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}. The agents of this covert espionage organization are spies, not assassins. Even lower-echelon agents of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} know little of its structure and membership. Its deep agents have spent centuries establishing their covers. It is not a guild in and of itself; few people outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is used. Members of the house who wish to operate their own independent intelligence agencies can be licensed by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, though the house keeps a close watch on such endeavors.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has a liaison that acts as the go-between with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, but this agent knows little of the operations in the city; the true spymaster will always be hidden. While it is a simple matter to deal with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} does not advertise its presence. A character seeking to employ the shadowy services of the house can inquire at a main enclave. If the request is worthwhile, it is passed to the Serpentine liaison. When the time is right, an agent will approach the prospective client to discuss the job at hand.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Carnival of Shadows. </strong>The Carnival of Shadows is a premier carnival that travels throughout Khorvaire. It has enthralled people since decades before the Last War. It is a a traveling Phiarlan circus combining illusion, physical arts, and exotic beasts from across Eberron.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/carnival-of-shadows.webp\" /></div>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Shadows.</strong> Although there is a strong rivalry between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, there is a strict limit to the feud: no assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni, he'll try to prove his superior skills, but he won't expose the rival spy. It's a game. But there is a third player, and it doesn't follow the rules. The Bloody Shadows are the survivors of the Paelion line, those skilled or lucky enough to escape the extermination attempt. Though few in number, the Bloody Shadows are lethal assassins, careful and patient. The Shadows want to make their cousins suffer; a Bloody Shadow might draw out his vengeance against a Phiarlan PC over months or years, causing as much pain as possible before striking the final blow.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Organizations in House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan as an Organization]{House Phiarlan as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{People of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Spirit Keepers]{Spirit Keepers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan in the World]{House Phiarlan in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Phiarlan]{Playing a Member of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_v6ohxlugu8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.</p>\n<p>Dol Dorn is the most martial of the Sovereign Host. He is the patron of all who fight for a living—among them soldiers, gladiators, and athletes. He leads the Sovereign Host in battle, and legend holds that he forced the Dark Six from the Host’s ranks. Dol Dorn despises those who shed blood in the name of cruelty or greed, or who glory in mindless violence. He always stands by the soldier who fights for duty or homeland and favors games, sport, and honorable competition. Although he does not bless an unjust cause, he protects warriors forced into battle by a bloodthirsty ruler.</p>\n<p>Most often depicted as a heavily muscled human, sometimes as a dwarf or a half-orc, and occasionally as a silver dragon, he is said to be the brother of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Mockery]{the Mockery}.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> War, athleticism, competition</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Longsword crossed over a shield, a silver dragon, or the Octogram in red and silver, representing blood and steel</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Longsword</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> Most of Dol Dorn’s priests are soldiers or athletes. Only a very few are incapable of holding their own in combat or competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Quests:</strong> Priests of Dol Dorn quest to prove their athletic or martial prowess, seeking out champions and besting them (though they are expected to do so in the service of some greater purpose). They often seek lopsided battles, striving to turn the tide in the favor of the underdogs.</li>\n<li><strong>Prayers and Rites:</strong> Sacrifices to Dol Dorn often require petitioners to shed their own blood, proving their willingness to endure pain for what is right. Nearly all Vassals pray and sacrifice to Dol Dorn before going into battle or engaging in physical competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Shrines:</strong> Dol Dorn’s temples are normally built of stone, resembling small fortresses more than religious edifices.

The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has always been a dynamic and energetic organization, willing to bend rules and push boundaries.

Members of the two circles often quarrel, and mystical duels are not uncommon.</p>\n<p>Members of the Guild of Starlight and Shadows usually want to know the details before casting a spell, but they have no traditions requiring that they obtain this knowledge, and for an extra 25% fee no questions are asked. In addition to straightforward spellcasting services and item creation, many members of the Guild work for dream parlors—cabarets that use exotic displays of illusion to entertain customers. The forces of the law are often suspicious of members of the Guild, and a character who belongs to the Guild of Starlight and Shadows must deal with this prejudice if he ever runs afoul of the law.</p>\n<p>The Guild of Starlight and Shadows currently has 152 members spread across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. Approximately 48 of these are sorcerers, with 27 artificers and 27 wizards in the same level range.

These are not hereditary positions as the kingships enjoyed by the royalty of the Five Nations, though some bloodlines produce more leaders than others. Instead, rulership of each principality goes to the strongest, the toughest, and the most accomplished sailor or pirate or merchant lord in the pack. Determining the next prince (a term applied to both male and female rulers in the Principalities) can sometimes be a violent, bloody affair. In general, the captain with the largest fleet, the most powerful sailing vessel, or the greatest popular support takes the banner of prince for his or her Principality, but tests of skill, of battle, or even of wits have been used to select leaders among the islands of Lhazaar.</p>\n<p>The most often used title among the rulers of the Principalities is prince. Other rulers give themselves titles such as sea baron, pirate lord, merchant king, captain, admiral, or duke. Such titles all depend on the traditions of the particular principality and the wishes of the current ruler. While a piece of land, which usually includes a dock or seaport and a small village, accompanies each ruler’s title, the true wealth and power behind the captain’s chair remains the ruler’s flagship and the size of his or her fleet. A prince can hold acres of land, but without a powerful flagship and a fleet of support vessels to sail the sea, he or she has no real power in the Principalities.</p>\n<p>Each principality maintains a number of lesser leadership roles that usually remain filled by the same people despite how often the prince’s crown changes hands. These administrators, navigators, shipwrights, and other positions necessary to the continued existence of the principality often attract and keep those best suited to the jobs assigned them. Occasionally a prince comes along who refuses to honor an existing rank or position and wants to place his or her own minions in power, but this is the exception and not the rule.</p>\n<p>Few of the dragonmarked houses operate in the Principalities. The exceptions include @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, which has made its headquarters here since breaking away from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}, which follows trade and cargo across the continent regardless of which borders it crosses; and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which reluctantly maintains the island prison called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dreadhold]{Dreadhold}.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

But I can also ease your burdens by ending your life.\"<span class=\"author\">—Lady Elara d'Thuranni,<br />shadow dancer</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Given @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni's} short history and specific focus, you are expected to further the interests of the house at every opportunity. These are the house's formative years as an independent entity, and every move you make is watched closely. This is not to say that every heir of Thuranni must actively spy at the behest of house elders, but even the house's most insular artists and artisans are expected to keep up with current political events, and to pass on or collect information when asked.</p>\n<p>By choosing the path of espionage, you are joining a secret society that monitors its agents closely. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} differs from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} in both its agenda and its methods, and prospective members are encouraged to remember this. Because of its aggressive techniques, the network relies heavily on the loyalty of its members. As such, serving efficiently and consistently is the surest way to earn the respect of one's peers within the house.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/dragonmarks/thuranni-shadow-stalker.webp\" width=\"355\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Once a course of action has been determined and set, only death or the direct order of a superior can deter you from carrying it out. Like your Phiarlan kin, you are a master at sizing up your opponents, whether in advance or in the thick of the fight. Whenever possible, you try to set the terms by which combat takes place.</p>\n<p>The Thuranni attitude toward combat dictates that you should always consider whether death is your intention. Assassination is one thing, but a simple escalation of tension should always be resolvable. Arguments should never end with blood spilled, but if death is required, you prefer to deliver it as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>As a young house, Thuranni can ill afford mistakes— particularly conspicuous ones. Ambition and talent will take you far in the house, but only espionage work that shows results and goes undetected will see that ambition and talent recognized.</p>\n<p>Because its artistic endeavors are so closely tied to its spying, Thuranni expects its heirs to be as ambitious with their creativity as they are with their undercover work. Heirs should strive to make an impression in their artistic field, and to cultivate a reputation that grants them access to the upper levels of Khorvairian society and the secrets held there.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>Undertaking missions for the Shadow Network requires strength and certainty in equal proportions. If the companions in your party are not of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, they need to respect that you have ties you cannot disclose—or will need to be replaced with new allies. The house has next to no sympathy for those who would jeopardize its existence with even a moment's indiscretion.</p>\n<p>Thuranni chooses its clients and assignments carefully, and any mission you are given will be as important as it is likely dangerous. As with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, Thuranni agents specialize in making magical observation easier by getting close to targets on the ground. Especially with the house's growing reputation as assassins, the most important part of any mission is to ensure that your work goes undetected.</p>\n<p>Should your work for the house bring you into the service of the Dragon's Path, you can expect your assignments to encompass more than the routine politics of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the dragonmarked houses. The eternal question of what destiny the dragonmarked serve lingers deep in the heart of your house. As a result, you might find yourself engaging in more traditional adventuring—seeking old lore, reclaiming relics of the past, digging through lost tombs—in your ongoing search for the secrets of the past and future. Such expeditions might even bring you into contact with the dragons themselves, about whom your superiors are always cautiously interested in learning more.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Organizations in House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]{House Thuranni as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Thuranni]{People of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni in the World]{House Thuranni in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Thuranni]{Playing a Member of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_7hlrvwctt1n","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

While Port Verge is not as large or as modern as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, Kolberkon has plans to build it up until it rivals or surpasses Ryger’s base. To accomplish this goal, Kolberkon has made alliances with the Order of the Emerald Claw and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} to gain the capital necessary to expand and rebuild the town.

{"_id":"rVZShxrgNpzqXsSK","name":"Mabar","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Mabar</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Endless Night</h2>\n<p>A sea of liquid shadows laps against black sands and basalt cliffs. A skull lies half-buried in the sand, empty sockets gazing into the roiling mist. The bone isn’t sun-bleached, for there is no sun here—only a faint glimmer from the smoky gray moon that hangs in the sky.</p>\n<p>Early scholars studying reports of Mabar concluded that it was the Plane of Darkness— that this physical property is its defining concept. However, the plane’s eternal gloom is just a symptom of its true nature. Even the brightest day eventually ends in darkness, and Mabar embodies this idea. It’s the shadow that surrounds every island of light, patiently waiting to consume it. It’s entropy, despair, and loss. This isn’t the place where the souls of the living go after death, but rather, it’s the plane of death itself—the hunger that consumes both light and life.</p>\n<p>Mabar is the source of negative energy, and the origin of most undead. Manifest zones—and most undead—tied to Mabar consume the life force from the world around them. However, some people maintain that negative energy itself is just a tool, and that the power of Mabar can be harnessed for good.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>The Endless Night consumes life and light. It’s a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/mabar-symbol.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Necrotic Power. </strong>A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against necromancy spells. An undead creature has 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and advantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.</p>\n<p><strong>Radiant Void.</strong> In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Shadows.</strong> There is no bright light in Mabar. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hunger of Mabar.</strong> Mabar consumes the life force of living things. For every minute a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 10d6 points of necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar, creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage, and creatures under the effects of a death ward spell are immune to the effects of this property.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Time.</strong> Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few ways Mabar can influence the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>Mabaran manifest zones are infamous and almost universally shunned, for nearly all are harmful to the flora and fauna of the region. In some zones, life withers and dies. In others, it’s twisted in strange ways; plants may seek the blood of living creatures, or grow unnaturally pale and cold. Rot and decay are often accelerated, and disease can thrive. However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns— which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.</p>\n<p>While Mabaran manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, they are powerful sources of negative energy and produce undead. Skeletons, zombies, and ghouls can all spontaneously rise in Mabaran manifest zones, and more powerful undead can be created under the proper circumstances.</p>\n<h3>CoterMinous and reMote</h3>\n<p>On nights when Mabar is coterminous, the Necrotic Power property encompasses the entire world, and the radius of all light sources are halved. During these periods, regions of deepest darkness can serve as gateways to Mabar, releasing shadows or other foul things into the world. This primarily occurs in regions that are suffused with despair or misery, and only at night, ending as soon as dawn breaks. As a result, during coterminous periods, friends and family usually huddle together indoors, keeping the lights burning and telling cheerful tales.</p>\n<p>When Mabar is remote, all creatures have resistance to necrotic damage, and undead have disadvantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Mabar is coterminous for three nights in the month of Vult—the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice. The people of the Five Nations call this time Long Shadows. Mabar is remote less frequently, for a period of five days around the summer solstice, but only once every five years.</p>\n<h3>Mabaran artifacts</h3>\n<p>Mabaran artifacts are formed from quintessence, the solidified energy of Mabaran shadows. This matte black substance can be used in a similar way to wood, metal, or cloth. Quintessence items are powerful conduits for necromancy and necrotic energy; a staff of withering, sword of wounding, or sword of life stealing might be made from Mabaran quintessence. Items that create undead or consume light might also be crafted from quintessence; such items drain joy and empathy from those that carry them, and those who wield such items often become cold and cruel. Yugoloth artisans can create unique items with even greater powers, but the purpose of these tools is to spread despair and misery. Some drain Hit Dice from their wielders to pay for their deadly abilities; others cause the bearer to rise as an undead creature after death.</p>\n<p>The most powerful Mabaran artifacts are battleloths— yugoloths that have allowed themselves to be forged into objects to spread death and despair. These are intelligent and powerful, but drive their wielders down dark paths.</p>\n<p>When plants do grow in Mabaran manifest zones, they’re often poisonous; bloodvine can produce a variety of deadly venoms. However, the elves of the Bloodsail Principality have mastered the art of gardening in Mabaran zones, and there, you can find wondrous plants that feed on shadows instead of sunlight—darkwood trees, ebon sedge grass, and more. Here, they produce spices and wines unlike any others in the world.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/mabar-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_34qzu11iqmg","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

According to legend, the Great Crag was torn up from the earth during the war between the hobgoblins and the daelkyr. The ruins of an ancient hobgoblin city are scattered across the plain, and ancient passages honeycomb the mountain itself. For centuries, the area was shunned and said to be cursed, but the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Daughters of Sora Kell]{Daughters of Sora Kell} have no fear of ancient superstitions. Over the past decade, the hags and their ogre laborers have built a great city at the base of the mountain. The Great Crag is a bizarre mix of architectural styles; beautifully restored buildings from the time of the Dhakaani Empire stand beside huge, rough structures that ogres have assembled using irregular stone blocks. Harpies live in roosts high on cliff faces, while the rest of the citizens make do with temporary tents and huts until more permanent structures are established. The court of the three sisters is carved into the mountain itself, consisting of a combination of rough-hewn passages and ancient chambers dating back to the hobgoblin empire.</p>\n<p>The Great Crag is a work in progress; its population outstrips its size. Thousands of goblin squatters live in camps scattered around the edges of the city, alongside well-organized gnoll barracks. An enormous arena covers one of the largest sections of the city. Here, races, gladiatorial combat, and blood sports of all types play out before packed crowds in the Crag.

The new king granted his sons and daughters—his warlords—these portions of the realm to govern in recognition of the help they provided in establishing the kingdom. Galifar had a vision for a unified empire that stretched across Khorvaire, and he trained his family for the many wars of conquest that would be required to establish his dream. As each son and daughter came of age, they became Galifar's warlords and generals, leading his armies to victory. Along the way, Galifar also trained them for the peace that would follow, honing five visionary leaders as he honed his weapons and troops for every battle.</p>\n<p>Galifar's eldest daughter, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair], governed the northwestern portion of the kingdom and helped shape the region that would eventually bear her name.</p>\n<p>The southwestern portion of the kingdom became the domain of Brey, Galifar's second daughter. During her reign, the region came to be called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland].</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre], youngest son of Galifar, governed the southeastern portion of the kingdom and gave his name to the region in 32 YK.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], the eastern region of the kingdom, was turned over to Galifar's eldest scion, Karrn, to govern. This area was the original seat of Galifar's power, and it was only natural that his oldest son would be granted control of the area.</p>\n<p>The southern portion of the kingdom became the domain of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane], Galifar's middle son. As with the other nations, the region adopted the name of its governor-prince in 32 YK.</p>\n<p>For almost a thousand years, the great kingdom of Galifar rose atop the pillars of the Five Nations to create an unprecedented age of peace and prosperity. For almost a thousand years, the scions of the kingdom governed the Five Nations and followed the rites of succession as put forth by Galifar the First during his forty-year reign. This honored tradition was abandoned a century ago, when the last king of Galifar, Jarot, died. For the first time in the history of the kingdom, the scions refused to honor the rites of succession. Each governor-prince eventually decided to claim the throne and the crown for himself or herself, and the kingdom broke apart in all-out war.</p>\n<p>To understand the Five Nations as they exist today (in the year 998 YK as reckoned by the people of Khorvaire), it helps to understand the history of this important region.</p>\n<h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE FIVE NATIONS</h2>\n<p>Humans arrived in eastern Khorvaire some three thousand years ago. They traveled across the Sea of Rage, leaving Sarlona for reasons that have been lost to the passing years. For the next thousand years, humans spread westward, struggling with the goblinoid tribes for the best portions of the land. Eventually, five major human settlements arose in central Khorvaire. These would become the Five Nations.</p>\n<p>For five hundred years, the five human settlements grew and fought with the neighboring goblinoids—the remnants of the once-powerful Dhakaani Empire. Then, two thousand years ago, human imperialism began. Karrn the Conqueror established the first human nation, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], along the northeastern shores of the great five-spoked river that divided the central continent. His armies defeated and drove the remaining goblinoids to the south. Then he turned his attention on his human neighbors.</p>\n<p>Karrn the Conqueror was a cruel and covetous man who believed that he was destined to rule over all of Khorvaire. He had built the most powerful human army up to that time, and after defeating the goblinoids he began a campaign to conquer the other four major human settlements. Karrn swept south, ostensibly to drive the remaining goblinoids into the wild regions, but actually invading the region that would one day become @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]. Caught by surprise, the region fell to Karrn. With two nations now claimed as part of his empire, Karrn's forces massed on the border of what would one day be called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane] and demanded the nation's immediate surrender.</p>\n<p>Before Karrn could claim another victory, the remaining three nations joined forces to stop the Conqueror's spread. What emerged from the carnage were five distinct human nations that spent the next thousand years alternately working together, competing for space and resources, and ultimately setting the stage for the great human civilization to come.</p>\n<p>Of course, while humans were the most numerous and in many of the key positions of power, the other common races participated in the rise of the Five Nations. Thanks to the growing economic strength of the dragonmarked houses, all the common races found a place in the developing human countries. Dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, and half-orcs started out as representatives and employees of their respective dragonmarked houses, but eventually members of each race settled down and made homes in the Five Nations. These neighborhoods began as house enclaves, becoming less attached to the houses as the common race populations in the nations grew.</p>\n<p>If Karrn taught the people of the Five Nations anything, he taught them to establish national identities. For a thousand years, the Five Nations expanded and developed unique personalities. And they adopted names to further distinguish themselves from each other.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Five Nations Name</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Pre-Galifar Name</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Galifar/Current Name</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thaliost</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wroat</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metrol</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]/Mournland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Daskara</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>THE COMING OF GALIFAR</h2>\n<p>Galifar Wynarn, of the bloodline of Karrn the Conqueror, entered the world one thousand and fortythree years ago, born to the warlord of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]. Galifar assumed leadership of the nation just before his twenty-first birthday, upon the death of his father. He grew up during the Border Wars, a decade-long conflict that saw the Five Nations battle over land rights and water sources. He saw the cruelty and shortsightedness of the warlords, including his father, and he decided that those currently in charge were wasting the potential of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p>Galifar envisioned a united kingdom made up of five equal parts, where petty disagreements were put aside and the people worked to improve life and advance the human condition. Young Galifar studied the exploits of his famous ancestor and decided that in many ways Karrn had the right idea. Only by combining their resources and efforts could the nations achieve the next level of civilization. Where Karrn failed, in Galifar's opinion, was in his cruelty, his blood lust, and his desire for aggrandizement above all other concerns. Galifar swore to avoid these failings and find a higher purpose to lead the way.</p>\n<p>During the first decade of his rule over @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], Galifar began preparations to see his dream become a reality. While Galifar hoped to convince the Five Nations to accept his plan, he knew that his best chance of uniting the kingdom was to have a powerful army to assure compliance. He expanded the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] military and set the best minds in the nation to helping him plan the kingdom he envisioned building. Then, in the eighth year of his reign, he began negotiations with the leaders of the other nations. It didn't take the other warlords long to reject Galifar and his plans for a unified kingdom.</p>\n<p>Undeterred, Galifar continued to explore diplomatic approaches to unity for the next two years. Each demonstration of shortsightedness and refusal on the parts of the other warlords simply made Galifar more determined to bring his vision to reality. On the tenth anniversary of his rise to power in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], Galifar began a military campaign to build the kingdom he dreamed of. For the next fourteen years, this campaign would rage across central Khorvaire. During this period, Galifar demonstrated his military genius time and time again, and his children grew to become his chief lieutenants as each reached the appropriate age.</p>\n<p>While Galifar and his forces didn't win every battle in the war to establish the kingdom, they did win the most important ones. Over the course of the war, the warlord-who-would-be-king made two influential diplomatic ploys that helped ensure his eventual victory. The first was to take the dragonmarked houses out of the conflict and gain their support by offering them special status in the new kingdom. The second was to take his dream directly to the people of the Five Nations, allowing him to slowly win the hearts and minds of those he hoped to lead.</p>\n<p>Fourteen years after the war began, the Five Nations laid down their arms and surrendered to Galifar. True to his word, Galifar didn't come as a conqueror from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]—he proclaimed himself king of a new kingdom composed of five equal parts. (Originally, it was simply \"the Kingdom\" or \"Galifar's Kingdom.\" It didn't officially adopt the name Galifar until the second decade of the king's rule.) To ensure loyalty and to push his postwar programs, he appointed each of his five children to manage the affairs of the Five Nations. As governor-princes, they would administer their portions of the realm in his name, as well as serve on a ruling council that would advise and support the new king. It helped that, in the end, the common folk respected and grew to love Galifar and his scions, seeing them as just, fair, and ultimately visionary rulers.</p>\n<p>Galifar established that the oldest living scion would ascend to the throne upon the ruler's death or abdication, whichever came first. Thus, the traditions and patterns surrounding the succession of power were set in place, helping to keep the kingdom going until King Jarot's scions broke the pattern in 894 YK.</p>\n<h2>THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>King Jarot, the last king of the great Kingdom of Galifar, set the stage for the fall of the kingdom and the start of the Last War. Dark dreams of a terrible future plagued Jarot, and paranoia slowly filled his every thought as time went on. He feared the dragonmarked houses. He believed that his aristocracy and nobility were plotting against him. He hated the realm of Aerenal, totally convinced that the ancestor-worshiping elves coveted his beloved domain. To these concerns, Jarot added the threats he believed were watching from distant Argonnessen and Riedra, waiting for the first sign of weakness before they launched devastating attacks. Worst of all, in Jarot's mind, were the unknown horrors that filled the mysterious continent of Xen'drik. Nightmares of this strange land haunted him, and deep down he knew that the ruination of his realm would come from that direction.</p>\n<p>Without revealing his overt fears, but with a desire to protect the kingdom and its people from the threats he believed were amassing all around him, King Jarot began a series of public works projects and secret experiments designed to reinforce the kingdom's infrastructure and borders while also increasing its capacity for war. Out of these projects were born the warforged, the floating fortresses of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland], and other magical wonders. During the same period, the lightning rail expanded throughout the kingdom, and Jarot's beloved and trusted children—the governorprinces of the Five Nations—increased their standing armies and magical arsenals. And then the kingdom waited for the war Jarot feared was approaching like a chill breeze on a hot, still night.</p>\n<p>The war that Jarot feared never erupted during his life. However, thanks in no small part to the preparations he orchestrated, it broke out with his death. The war, proclaimed to be the Last War by the Korranberg Chronicle, was fought not against some terrible external enemy—it was fought among the Five Nations as the Kingdom of Galifar collapsed from within.</p>\n<p>In 894 YK, King Jarot died. His scions decided to break with tradition, using the armies they had fostered to take the crown for themselves. For more than a century, the Five Nations were at war. Other nations arose during the conflict, shattering Galifar's dream into more than a dozen fragments. In the end, no single victor emerged. Instead, compromises were reached and a treaty was drawn up to put a stop to the endless battles. Now, in 998 YK, the fragile peace holds—but for how long?</p>\n<h2>THE FIVE NATIONS TODAY</h2>\n<p>The Last War officially ended two years ago with the signing of the Treaty of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thronehold]. Four years ago, the nation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre] disappeared in a terrible and unexplained conflagration that turned the entire area into a devastated region now known as the Mournland. Today, in addition to the remaining four of the Five Nations, the old kingdom has been divided into fifteen distinct countries, twelve of which were recognized by the historic treaty.</p>\n<p>In the largest cities of Khorvaire, idealists rejoice that the war has finally ended. Lightning rails and trade roads are once again open to those with the money and means to travel. Marketplaces again bustle with merchandise and goods from all corners of the continent. Only five years ago, a noble would have paid handsomely to enjoy Brelish cheese and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundairian} wine in the same meal, but now such trade is once again common. At the same table where such a meal is shared, ideas and tales are exchanged, and many learn about nations and people they were once taught to fear.</p>\n<p>For all the open smiles and friendly handshakes, old grudges do not die easily. The Five Nations have a century of dark memories of rivalries and atrocities to put behind them, and forgetting such things is never easy. For every border that has been moved, someone's home or family has been displaced. For every battle lost or won, someone's loved one has died. Friendships and alliances may still defy national boundaries, but there are those who plot retribution and renewed mayhem.</p>\n<p>Cities such as Sharn demonstrate an ability to live openly with representatives of all nations, races, and ideologies, but such progressive thinking doesn't extend across the countryside. Can you help extend this period of peace and hold off the flames of the next war? No matter where you start on the map, a world of adventure awaits. Let's explore the Five Nations!</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dbx1it7l0h8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} has no interest in opening up to those outside the house. As a result, though it offers artistic training through the True Shapers, such training has no connection to the artistic or espionage activities of the Shadow Network.</p>\n<h2>THE SHADOW NETWORK</h2>\n<p>Thuranni's answer to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild} is the Shadow Network, a single organization that encompasses both the house's public and private services. Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, which operates the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} as a separate branch of the house, Thuranni's Shadow Network is an integrated guild. As such, virtually all Thuranni's artists are involved to some degree in espionage activities, even if only by being aware that their business helps obscure them.</p>\n<p>Agents of the Shadow Network must be loyal to a fault, for they are entrusted with secrets and tasks of critical importance to both the house and its clients. In particular, the Shadow Network accepts assassination work more readily than the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, and this secret is one that network members protect with their lives. Low-level agents of the Shadow Network are typically better informed as to the details of their assignments than their counterparts in the Serpentine Table.</p>\n<p>Where the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} is but one aspect of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], its mirror sect among the Thuranni is the true face of the house—and all other sects merely veils of convenience. The talent and vision of Thuranni artists is real, but so too is the dedication with which they pursue other, darker arts.</p>\n<p>Like Phiarlan's espionage network, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} divides its agents into four ranks. Unlike in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, shadow is the highest rank a member can hope to attain. Those of lowest rank are known as <em>wisps</em>, and they represent a small majority of its membership. <em>Apparitions </em>coordinate groups of <em>wisps</em>, while <em>phantasms </em>are elite operatives and field agents. Each operative is further defined by one of two descriptors. The <em>bright </em>classification signifies an agent who excels at missions of an aggressive nature, including assassination; the <em>pale </em>classification denotes an agent who specializes in deep cover missions of finesse. Though rumors of a fifth rank, an office known as the <em>Master of Shadows</em>, have circulated through Thuranni in recent years, little evidence supports such tales.</p>\n<h2>True Shapers</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} observes the traditional hierarchy of the dragonmarked, but also maintains divisions based on the roles heirs play within the house. Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} still maintains its own center for the Demesne of Shape in Thaliost, all serious students of architecture, costuming, painting, pottery, and sculpture study at the true heart of the discipline—the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} enclave in the Karrnathi city of Atur. Thuranni calls its demesne the True Shapers as an unsubtle jibe toward Phiarlan, and students from all races and nations study under its master artists and artisans. The True Shapers is run by Lord Eriz d'Thuranni.</p>\n<h2>Dragon's Path</h2>\n<p>At the core of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni], the Dragon's Path remains dedicated to unraveling the draconic Prophecy as it unfolds on Eberron. Composed primarily of older house members with a strong sense of history and a working knowledge of magic, the Dragon's Path includes architects, astrologers, historians, and the field agents who do their bidding. The traditions of the Dragon's Path are unique, and do not overlap with the dragon prophets, the work of the Chamber, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} study of the prophecy. Members of the order believe that the dragons have kept their knowledge of the Prophecy to themselves for far too long, and recall the dragon wars of Aerenal as proof that the great wyrms' agenda sees the \"lesser races\" as expendable if need be. The order is administered and convened by Viceroy Ureilya d'Thuranni.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Crooked Kin. </strong>The Crooked Kin are a troupe of performers and sideshow freaks who travel throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenta Plains]{Talenta Plains}, and parts of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} on the coast of Khorvaire. They have been  entertaining the good burghers and hamlets for a few decades. The entire show travels in a caravan of nine covered Vistani wagons pulled by nags. The wagons are gaudily painted and depict the show's performers beneath the legend, “The Crooked Kin— @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath's} Greatest Traveling Cabinet of Curiosities!” Each wagon has a front and back door opening onto cramped living accommodations inside. They have been licensed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} since the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}.</p>\n<p>The Crooked Kin consists of 13 performers, all people with a variety of physical handicaps or deformities, plus a handful of additional sideshow attractions. Though they all have exotic (or in some cases, frightening) appearances, the Kin are just honest performers trying to make a living, and are concerned for the life of one of their friends. The following people make up the Crooked Kin. <strong>Hap Tarvin, the Flea Man:</strong> A short, hunched man with a distorted appearance, Hap performs with his f lea circus, the Magnificent Carnival of Miniature Wonders. <strong>Kaleb Hesse, the Ringmaster:</strong> An albino man with red eyes and long, white hair that hangs below his knees, Kaleb wears a tall red top hat, a long red coat with gold buckles, and striped trousers. He is the de facto leader of the Crooked Kin. <strong>Lidia Gerod, the Bearded Lady:</strong> Standing nearly 7 feet tall and possessed of a fine beard down to her waist, Lidia acts as a sort of “mother hen” to the other members of the troupe. <strong>The Pinheads:</strong> Aleece, Lettie, and Poppy are sisters, all of whom havemicrocephaly. <strong>Prince Zar, the Human Caterpillar:</strong> This Mwangi man has no arms or legs. Prince Zar was once enslaved in a Chelish sideshow, but earned enough money to buy his freedom. He joined the Crooked Kin, where he is billed as an exiled prince of the “Lost Cities of Darkest Garund.” <strong>S'jeer, the Vudrani Princess:</strong> Born with four arms, S'jeer dresses in exotic silks and speaks with a thick accent, but she is actually from Galt and the daughter of a fishmonger. <strong>The Swarm of Clowns: </strong>These three men, Gerik, Josef, and Tam, each have an extra limb (Josef has three legs, the others have three arms). Besides their skill in clowning, they are also accomplished acrobats and jugglers. <strong>Trollblood, the Giant Man:</strong> A shockingly ugly Ulfen man nearly 8 feet tall, Trollblood entertains the crowds with fire-breathing and his feats of strength. <strong>The Wolf Child:</strong> Supposedly raised by wolves in the Nightwood, this 10-year-old boy is covered in hair. He is unfortunately insane, but the three pinhead sisters treat him like a younger brother. In addition, the show also includes a pair of caged goblin dogs, a morlock, and a giant frog.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Shadows.</strong> Although there is a strong rivalry between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], there is a strict limit to the feud: no assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni, he'll try to prove his superior skills, but he won't expose the rival spy. It's a game. But there is a third player, and it doesn't follow the rules. The Bloody Shadows are the survivors of the Paelion line, those skilled or lucky enough to escape the extermination attempt. Though few in number, the Bloody Shadows are lethal assassins, careful and patient. The Shadows want to make their cousins suffer; a Bloody Shadow might draw out his vengeance against a Phiarlan PC over months or years, causing as much pain as possible before striking the final blow.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Organizations in House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]{House Thuranni as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Thuranni]{People of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni in the World]{House Thuranni in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Thuranni]{Playing a Member of House Thuranni}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_7hlrvwctt1n","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"tJSODqHKoISfrKHj","name":"Daughters of Sora Kell","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Daughters of Sora Kell</h1>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell are the legendary rulers of a savage land. For generations, parents in western Khorvaire have used tales of Sora Maenya to frighten disobedient children, and numerous heroes have tried (and failed) to match wits with Sora Katra. The Daughters of Sora Kell are all ritual casters, with Sora Teraza the most accomplished among them. Teraza maintains a vast library of books in the Great Crag, including ritual tomes from the Age of Demons.</p>\n<p>If the PCs choose to fight against @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, they might eventually come into direct conflict with the Daughters of Sora Kell. However, the hags are more likely to enter a campaign as an enigmatic mystery than a direct threat. Sora Katra might play an elaborate game with the PCs, with no apparent gain for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. Sora Teraza might aid them, providing oracular advice at a critical moment.</p>\n<p>If it comes to battle, the Daughters of Sora Kell have survived countless previous conflicts for good reason. If vastly overpowered, they flee without hesitation. If trapped, the hags use their considerable power and knowledge—the location of artifacts, the schemes of other villains—to bargain for their lives.</p>\n<p>These three hags are the driving force behind the rise of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} as a nation. In addition to their own inherent abilities and their powers as a covey, the sisters have assembled a host of powerful ogres and trolls. Alchemical serums, enchantments, and the charismatic words of Sora Katra have turned these vicious creatures into fanatical killers who are willing to die for their queens. While this army of giants forms the backbone of the hags’ hold over @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, in the last decade creatures of all types have flocked to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Great Crag]{the Great Crag} to join the forces of the three sisters. For the moment the hags are dispersing many of these volunteers to serve as mercenaries in other parts of Khorvaire. This tactic puts gold in the hags’ coffers and gives them eyes and ears outside @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}. It also has the effect of making it difficult to determine just how many monsters the sisters have under their command.</p>\n<p>Although they work together to solidify the nation and extend their influence beyond @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, the three sisters have very different personalities and motivations. It was Sora Teraza who gathered the covey and set forth the blueprint for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} when she emerged from her long wanderings in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Demon Wastes]{Demon Wastes}. Sora Katra seized upon the idea as an intriguing mental challenge, while Sora Maenya relished the opportunity for battle and bloodshed. The three sisters are described below.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/people/daughters-of-sora-kell.webp\" /></p>\n<h3>Sora Kell and her Daughters</h3>\n<p><strong>Sora Kell</strong> is an ancient night hag with exceptional powers. She is said to have dealt with dragons and demons in the first age of the world, and to have tricked the Sovereigns themselves. Even though she is immortal, there have been no new legends of her deeds since the advent of Galifar, but that's when her daughters rose to infamy. All three of the Daughters of Sora Kell possess powers far beyond what's usual for their kind. They are creatures of legend, beings who have defeated many of the greatest heroes of Galifar.</p>\n<p><strong>Sora Katra </strong>is the voice of the Daughters. Charismatic and clever, she is an accomplished illusionist and shapeshifter who rarely wears the same face twice. Stories say that she weaves curses on her loom, and that she loves to match wits with heroes and champions. She speaks for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and is always interested in intrigues and plots.</p>\n<p>Katra speaks at all public gatherings and deals with the envoys of other nations. Her diplomatic skills help maintain order among the warlords, with the aid of her army of giants. She is extremely clever, thriving on intellectual conflict and deception. At any given time she has half a dozen plots underway; she uses the covey’s hag eye to monitor and other magical items to maintain contact with a network of minions hidden among the monstrous mercenaries spread across Khorvaire. These schemes are usually relatively small, idle plots that keep her wits sharp as she works toward her greater goals focused on her new kingdom. Recently she has been quietly building a criminal guild in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}; known as the Monster’s Eye, the guild has been using the powers of its monstrous enforcers to overwhelm the competition. Her involvement, and the involvement of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} itself, is kept secret so as not to hamper her diplomatic efforts with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} and the other nations. In addition to the monsters of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, Katra has recruited a considerable number of changelings for the Monster’s Eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Sora Maenya </strong>is the commander of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam's} armies. It's said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. She binds the souls of her victims to their skulls, which she keeps in her lair. Her legendary physical strength is often displayed as she makes bloody examples of those who oppose (or simply displease) the sisters. For decades she spread fear through the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}. Though many stories depict her as merely a brute, she is a clever strategist and a master of intimidation and terror. She is a sensualist in every sense of the word and thrives on the visceral experience of combat. She often uses illusions to conceal her true identity while searching for new physical experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Sora Teraza </strong>is a mystery. Though blind, or perhaps because of her blindness, she possesses vast powers of divination. She is the most gifted oracle of the age, but her answers are often cryptic, even when dealing with her sisters; she might give vital advice even to her enemies. Katra and Maenya rely on Teraza to guide their actions and expose their enemies. Teraza, however, is always cryptic, even when dealing with her covey-sisters, and her advice does not always benefit the receiver. Some say that she is mad, and this may be true—or she may be playing an elaborate game that only she understands, using all of Khorvaire as the playing field. She acts as a channel for knowledge and is just as likely to help a stranger as her own sisters. She says what needs to be said to set events in motion—even if those events do not benefit her personally.</p>\n<h2>THE DAUGHTERS AND THE WAR</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} emerged as a nation in the final decade of the Last War. King Boranel of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} brokered an uneasy truce with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, but the other nations of Khorvaire have refused to recognize the Daughters' sovereignty. Most leaders believe @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} will soon collapse into chaos, or that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} will gather its strength and crush the Daughters. Others think that either of those assumptions gravely underestimates the abilities of the Daughters and their subjects.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the war, the fighting forces of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} have become a significant resource for other nations of Khorvaire. Gnolls, minotaurs, ogres, and other creatures have proven to be capable mercenaries and laborers, and the Daughters have worked with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk} to make these resources available to the rest of Khorvaire. This exchange both puts gold into the Daughters' coffers, and spreads their eyes and ears throughout the wider world.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_egso2zb0tcr","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The guilds' bookish reputations (and the insular nature of the house as a whole) means that many of those outside the other dragonmarked houses have little sense of where one begins and the other ends.</p>\n<h2>Notaries Guild</h2>\n<p>The Notaries Guild oversees services tied to the written word. In addition to producing legal documents and authenticating letters of credit for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, the guild licenses cartographers, bookbinders, scribes, translators, accountants, and others in related professions. A number of smaller branches within the Notaries Guild handle specialized work: <strong>Aureon's Press</strong> is the primary source of arcane ritual scrolls in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}, and the <strong>Hidden Word</strong> is a division that works on cryptography and code-breaking techniques.</p>\n<h2>Speakers Guild</h2>\n<p>The Speakers Guild maintains and operates the network of speaking stones and provides Sending ritual services. It also oversees a number of professions tied to the spoken word. The guild trains and licenses barristers, mediators, heralds, interpreters, and other similar professions. Although some of these services overlap with those of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, as a rule the Speakers Guild handles practical matters of communication, while @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} focuses on artistic endeavors.</p>\n<h2>Oversight</h2>\n<p>Oversight is the security arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}. Oversight is charged with protecting the house from all manner of spying and theft of information, but it also polices the house's members. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} reputation relies on the assurance of absolute confidentiality for clients; if an heir leaks confidential information, Oversight will act swiftly and ruthlessly. Oversight has strong ties to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}, and the Trust of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, and might call on these groups for assistance.</p>\n<h2>Tasker's Dream</h2>\n<p>Tasker's Dream is a think tank dedicated to developing new forms of magical and linguistic communication. In addition to working to improve upon the Sending ritual and the speaking stones, Tasker's Dream is exploring the potential of telepathy and even developing new languages.</p>\n<p>These practical projects provide cover for the true work of the unit. Tasker's Dream is dedicated to unlocking all secrets of linguistic magic, including the Draconic Prophecy itself. The Wordsmiths of Tasker's Dream will pursue any lead that could shed more light on the Prophecy, and are especially interested in Prophecy marks found etched into the earth. A PC who has ties to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} could be recruited to help the Dream unlock the secrets of the Prophecy, or to undermine its work if the Dream's plans go beyond house interests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Organizations in House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{People of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis as an Organization]{House Sivis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis in the World]{House Sivis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Sivis]{Playing a Member of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Impartial Voice]{The Impartial Voice}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-sivis-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_k6d9algq2g","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

It is the arcane mark of a Sivis scribe that proves the worth of a Kundarak letter of credit, and the speaking stones of House Sivis that allow an Aundairian sage to contact his brother in Q'barra. Whether serving as translators, mediators, or conduits for long-distance communication, the heirs of House Sivis build bridges between people, nations, and cultures. House Sivis has long served as a stabilizing force among the dragonmarked houses, and has maintained its reputation for absolute neutrality for nearly three thousand years.</p>\n<h2>House Sivis Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Sivis]{Organizations in House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Sivis]{People of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis as an Organization]{House Sivis as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis in the World]{House Sivis in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Sivis]{Playing a Member of House Sivis}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Impartial Voice]{The Impartial Voice}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-Sivis-coa.webp\" width=\"274\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>Zil society has long been dominated by influential clans, and the families within Clan Sivis were well established long before their mark appeared. To avoid the jealousy of rival clans, the Sivis gnomes made themselves as useful to their neighbors as possible, establishing the code of neutrality that they have upheld to this day.

He realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the other, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. From the moment young Galifar stood on the banks of Scions Sound and looked upon the mysterious island that rested just out of reach of the Five Nations, he knew that the island would play an important role in the realization of his dream of unification. On this island he would build his capital—Thronehold.</p>\n<p>Prior to Galifar, the island was considered to be haunted, a place of the old ways of Khorvaire. That reputation, and its location, made it the perfect place for Galifar's purposes. The great castle Thronehold became a shining symbol of the kingdom, and the island around it developed into a wondrous showcase for the realm. It remained so until the Last War, when it became a reminder of things lost.</p>\n<p>After Jarot's death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle of Thronehold were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect and maintain the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the united kingdom. The town of Throneport, a support community in the shadow of the castle, mutated as the Last War progressed. It became a place for dissidents, spies, criminals, and mercenaries, and the once opulent and safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without law or allegiance to any single nation.</p>\n<p>This neutrality has served Throneport well; by 975 YK it had grown into a small city in which all of the nations and dragonmarked houses had at least a small presence, turning it into a hotbed of international intrigue. The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified this position, establishing the city of Throneport as a multinational province under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dbx1it7l0h8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Rather than a simple extension of the house, the Warning Guild has grown into an affiliated but largely independent entity. The Mark of Detection often leads to meddling in unpleasant affairs; official separation keeps the house at a safe distance whenever the unpleasantness turns out to involve the nobility or the dragonmarked houses themselves.</p>\n<p>While the Warning Guild provides valuable experience and training for its members, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani's} ministers realize that not everyone's gifts are best suited to that path. Heirs and house members whose skills lie elsewhere are encouraged to pursue them, as long as those pursuits benefit the house eventually.</p>\n<h2>Warning Guild</h2>\n<p>The Warning Guild is administered by members of House Medani, and it reports to the Medani patriarch and his council quarterly with financial reports and news of particular interest to the house leadership. Members of the Warning Guild do not gather information in the same manner as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} agent, a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thuranni} operative, or even a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Ghallanda} barkeep. Rather, they piece together a map of the subtle plots threading Khorvaire by keeping those plots from coming to pass. Only when Aurum agents are revealed within the Brelish court can the chain of orders and intrigue that brought them there be carefully unraveled. When an assassination attempt against a Cannith seneschal is prevented, it unlocks layers of scheming that would otherwise never come to light.</p>\n<p>Bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire either are members of the Warning Guild or pay dues to obtain certification from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani}. There's some conflict with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} over the market in bodyguards, but @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} is small and subtle enough that it hasn't caused a major rift yet. In general, people hire a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{House Deneith} bodyguard when they expect to be attacked, and they hire a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} bodyguard when they suspect someone might be plotting against them, but they aren't sure who.</p>\n<p>The Warning Guild also provides some intelligence functions to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} leadership (and, by extension, to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}). But the members of this guild aren't spies—they're the people who catch spies. Their information is often better at explaining the motives behind another nation's actions than it is at predicting and countering what that nation will do. After all, when Medani learns what a captured spy was trying to find out, that knowledge reveals a lot about what the spy's masters don't know yet but would like to.</p>\n<h2>Thousand Yard Stare</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} secured a contract from the governments of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} to have its members patrol the periphery of the Mournland and provide early warning of monsters or strange magical phenomena crossing into settled lands. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} gave the riders a typically circumspect name (the “Western Mournland Working Group”). But after the first patrols came back to civilization with a haunted look in their eyes, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} locals started calling them the “Thousand Yard Stare,” and the name stuck. In the three years that the Thousand Yard Stare has been watching the border of the Mournland, its members have provided early warning of everything from strangely twisted giants on the march to living spells spinning out of control. But the Thousand Yard Stare can't be everywhere, so the dangers of the Mournland sometimes cross the Brey River or the dead-gray mist.</p>\n<h2>Basilisk's Gaze</h2>\n<p>Secret codicils to the Treaty of Thronehold listed war criminals wanted by each of the Five Nations, and ever since the end of the Last War, a group of Medani operatives known as the Basilisk's Gaze has been charged with tracking down and apprehending these war criminals. Many of those named in the codicils are living openly elsewhere in Khorvaire. In the two years since the war's end, the Basilisk's Gaze has apprehended dozens of terrorists and war criminals, but that's only a small portion of the names listed in the codicils.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Organizations in House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Medani]{People of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani as an Organization]{House Medani as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani in the World]{House Medani in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Medani]{Playing a Member of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Warning Signs]{Warning Signs}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-medani-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_d88gz4ty0vs","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Most settlements were squalid and confused. Sickness ran rampant, worsening the people’s suffering. As the number of refugees grew, it was clear that the camps would not suffice. Boranel granted the Cyran ambassador, Prince Oargev ir’Wynarn, permission to found a town for his people. By king’s edict, the residents would be subject to Cyran authority and live as they saw fit. The Cyrans appreciated the gesture and named the town New Cyre, but most remain aware that they were granted territory no one else wanted. Many of them resent the fact that they’re trapped inside their former enemy’s lands, with nowhere else to go.</p>\n<p>What started as a refugee village in the wake of the destruction of Cyre has rapidly grown into a large town with over four thousand inhabitants. While the disaster that destroyed the nation to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland's} east wiped out much of the Cyran population, those living near the western border had enough time to cross over into the Brelish countryside ahead of the strange wall of dead-gray mist that eventually stopped just a few miles to the east of Vathirond and Kennrun. King Boranel took pity on the refugees and established the camps that evolved into a village and then a town.</p>\n<p>Today, New Cyre sits on a trade road southeast of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wroat]{Wroat}, in the middle of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland's} eastern farm country. The prince of the city, Oargev ir’Wynarn (LN male human, aristocrat 3/fighter 1), is the last son of Cyre’s ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} when the mysterious disaster befell his nation and has since become the unofficial leader of the Cyran refugees scattered throughout the other domains. He hopes to one day gather all of Cyre’s homeless children to this refuge in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. His other desire revolves around discovering the truth behind the destruction of his kin and country, and exacting revenge on the guilty parties. Until then, he graciously accepts the hospitality of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} (even if the Brelish have given him unwanted land in the middle of nowhere) and works to rebuild the confidence and honor of his subjects. He serves as mayor of New Cyre while also playing the role of a king in exile.</p>\n<p>The people of New Cyre work as farmers while their prince plots and plans the future glory of the Cyran crown. Prince Oargev regularly seeks out news and information from those foolish or brave enough to venture into the Mournland. He has been known to fund expeditions into the blasted, wasted remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to discover some hint or clue that points to the cause of Cyre’s demise. In the meantime, Oargev works to improve the plight of his people and dreams of rebuilding Cyre—either in a restored Mournland or someplace else entirely.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The outlines of windows have been engraved into the outer walls, but the walls are solid; apparently the architect considered it to be some sort of artistic statement. The Gray House has passed through the hands of a number of Karrnathi nobles over the last three centuries. While the people of Ocean View generally distrust foreigners, the inhabitants of the Gray House are invariably charming and charismatic—and vampires. The Gray House has long been used as a safe house for undead associated with the Order of the Emerald Claw. The current lady of the house is <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Jesel Tarra'az</em></span>.

Raised and trained at the Crimson Monastery, she is a deadly undead warrior. However, she rarely takes an active part in Order operations in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. Her role is to provide visiting operatives with information and equipment; she takes no actions that could compromise her position in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}, even if it means that a particular operation fails. Jesel has concealed her true nature from the Karrnath embassy, and does her best to avoid all contact with embassy staff.

{"_id":"uGiTQQefJFUMUU98","name":"Rickety's Squibs","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Rickety's Squibs</h1>\n<p><strong>Independent merchant</strong></p>\n<p>Rickety’s Squibs refits and modifies the lines and profiles of ships without changing a ship’s size, characteristics, or deck layout, providing both discretion and a new identity for a price. These rebuilt vessels are referred to as “squibs.” In fact, “It’s like as not to be a squib,” is a common saying among the pirates of the Shackles for a ship of suspicious origin.</p>\n<p>Rickety’s Squibs lies in the estuary of a nameless river in Cliff's End. The river mouth is concealed from passing ships by a protruding headland, so that it is difficult to find if one doesn’t know where to look, and the facilities are hidden under the eaves of the encroaching jungle, further warding them from prying eyes. </p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Rounding the tall headland reveals a hidden cove at the mouth of a wide jungle river, its sluggish brown waters staining the waters of the blue sea like an ugly bruise. A series of docks has been built upon this estuary, with buildings concealed beneath the overhanging limbs of the jungle beyond. A wooden watchtower stands upon the promontory of the headland, carefully concealed among the trees to provide a clandestine view of the seas.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Rickety Hake</h2>\n<p>Rickety’s Squibs is run by old Rickety Hake (N old male human expert 7), a retired buccaneer and former mate aboard the Bearded Whore under Captain Ella Gurnett (“Who fed the kraken at the battle of Nolis Point,” as Rickety is fond of relating).</p>\n<p>Rickety Hake is a short, stoop-backed old man with a leathery, weatherworn face; watery blue eyes; and a halo of frizzy white hair.</p>\n<h2>Squibbing</h2>\n<p>The entire existence of Rickety’s Squibs relies upon the service it provides in the refitting of ships. A squibbing costs 20% of a ship’s purchase price and requires a minimum of [[/r 1d4+4]] days to complete, at which point Rickety must make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair} check (he has a d10). Once a ship has been successfully squibbed, a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} check (–2) is required for someone familiar with the original ship to recognize the squib for what it is after observing it closely for at least 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>Determine the number of days the squibbing will require, and Rickety quotes that amount of time and a minimum price of 2,000 gp to squib. Rickety can also install hidden 5-foot-square smuggling compartments in the bulkheads of a ship for an additional 500 gp each (a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} check (–2) is required to locate such compartments in a search) with no increase to the time. At your discretion, Rickety can also install other ship improvements for additional costs and time.</p>\n<p>Rickety’s initial attitude is friendly as long as any pirates remain civil, though if attempts are made intimidate or insult him, he becomes neutral. If he is made neutral, all prices increase by 10% until Rickety is made friendly again.</p>\n<p>Once the price and work has been agreed upon, Rickety discusses payment methods. He requires proof that the funds necessary to complete the work are available witht the ship. In addition to coins, he also accepts items in trade at the normal 50% value (up to the community’s purchase limit), or plunder at standard percentages.</p>\n<p>If the funds are not on hand, Rickety offers other payment options. If there are prisoners that can be ransomed or sold into slavery, Rickety will purchase them at 50 gp a head to ransom or resell later in Bloodcove. Rickety may also offer to underwrite pirates as a major shareholder in their ship; he will have to be paid one-third of all plunder recovered until he is paid off in an amount equaling 150% of the refitting costs (he can be bargained down to 133% with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} check (–2)). If a irate renege on the deal, then the secret identity of the squib will be broadcast throughout the Lhazaar and the ship will be forfeit to Rickety should another pirate recover it. In the meantime, the pirates will have to return once a month to Rickety’s Squibs to show their books and pay out his share.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_k5ef3u4brq","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

In addition to this peaceful work, it maintains a massive intelligence network that stretches across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Khorvaire]{Khorvaire}. The house sells information and intelligence-gathering services to the most powerful people in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}.</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE PHIARLAN</h2>\n<p>In the past, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} allowed individuals to marry into the house only rarely; it would have been unusual to see two such unions in a single century. However, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism} was a great blow to the house, reducing both its population and the diversity of its family line.</p>\n<p>As such, Phiarlan's ranks have become more open to those outside the dragonmarked families, though only elves are ever considered for membership. A candidate must have exceptional artistic skill or remarkable talent in the arts of stealth and subterfuge. Experts are well represented within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, but its most gifted scions pursue the paths of rogue, scout, bard, wizard, or sorcerer. Phiarlan spellcasters typically focus on divination, enchantment, and illusion magic, which can be used both for the secret work of the house and for the entertainment activities that conceal it.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{Elf}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni} by blood or marriage or accepted based on extraordinary ability (at DM's discretion).</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Though player characters will likely be drawn to Phiarlan's espionage arm, the house derives most of its income from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}. Phiarlan entertainers cover a vast spectrum of the performing arts, and a typical Phiarlan enclave has musicians, actors, poets, dancers, and professional escorts available. Such characters are often experts or bards, with the occasional spellcaster versed in illusion magic. Rogues, scouts, and other combat-oriented characters might begin as entertainers, but are often more attracted to the Serpentine Table, the espionage arm of the house.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE PHIARLAN BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>The wealth of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} lies in the knowledge of its spies and the fame of its entertainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Since the services of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are available only to those of great wealth or rank, house membership is usually the only way for adventurers to hire Phiarlan spies. The house's intelligence services are normally not discounted (but see Information, below).</p>\n<p>The fame of Phiarlan's entertainers can benefit player characters in a number of ways. First, if they are performers themselves, they can ask the house to help find a local venue and to promote their performances. Even after the house takes its cut, PCs receive a bonus of from 5% to 20% (1d4×5) to the income generated by their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} members can make use of current information uncovered by members of the Serpentine Table in the course of their work. While in a house enclave, a member can gain a +1 bonus on a single knowledge or lore check per day.</p>\n<p>Though characters typically have to pay for the house's intelligence services, a Phiarlan agent might volunteer information to a fellow heir, warning her of a potential threat or the activities of a mutual enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The house can provide routine access to low-level, invitation-only social events, arranging for characters who are not performers to gain entry as part of an entourage.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Organizations in House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan as an Organization]{House Phiarlan as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{People of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Spirit Keepers]{Spirit Keepers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan in the World]{House Phiarlan in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Phiarlan]{Playing a Member of House Phiarlan}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eyes of all Nations]{Eyes of all Nations}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_v6ohxlugu8","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Those who crow too loudly may catch the jealous eye of the Keeper. Even the mightiest hero can be laid low by disease or ill fortune, as the Keeper has a vast arsenal to bring down those that he desires. Once he pulls you down into the darkness, he will snatch your soul before it can reach @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dulurrh]{Dulurrh} and add you to his endless hoard, where he can toy with you and torment you until the end of time.</p>\n<p>The Keeper is the patron of those who put personal gain above all else.

A rogue who invokes @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Olladra]{Olladra} sees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals—though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there’s no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could easily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your entertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?</p>\n<p>Another possible path for a player character or deadly NPC is that of being a Keeper’s Fang.

When the elves came to the island, they found almost no vegetation; Farlnen is close to the plane of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mabar]{Mabar}, and full sunlight never reaches its stony soil. The Grim Lord Varonaen overcame this challenge, and the fruits of his labors can be seen today: darkwood trees and ebon sedge grass that feed on shadows instead of sunlight. Varonaen has continued his work over the course of generations, and the merchants of Farlnen trade spices and wines that cannot be produced anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p>The waters around the island are just as dangerous as the stories say. Basalt columns and treacherous reefs pose inanimate threats to those who don’t know the coastline, and the undead sentinels pose an even greater threat. Anything that roamed the water over the centuries might have been slain at some point and bound to protect Farlnen. Krakens? Dragon turtles? Worse? It’s up to you to decide what lies hidden in the dark water.</p>\n<h3>The Faces of Farlnen</h3>\n<p>Farlnen is a dark reflection of Aerenal. The cities are made of basalt and darkwood, and the sun never pierces the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mabar]{Mabaran} haze that hangs over the island. Most of the elves who reside there have pale complexions, as one might expect in such a sunless land. However, children conceived when @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mabar]{Mabar} is close are sometimes born with jet­black skin; such elves can be mistaken for drow. Tattoos are used both aesthetically and as a sign of status. At a glance, Bloodsail facial tattoos are similar to the death mask designs employed by the Aereni, though the Bloodsails favor crimson inks. But to those who know the culture, these tattoos can reveal family line, mystical talent, and the bearer’s ship.</p>\n<p>Although Bloodsail merchants and privateers are found across the Lhazaar Principalities and the Bitter Sea, strangers receive a cold welcome in Farlnen. Port Cairn is the gateway to the island and the seat of Prince Tasil, but any visitor quickly realizes that the place has few families. It is home to travelers and those who cater to them, but the family estates lie in the interior and the Fingerbone Mountains. Foreigners who want to travel into the interior of Farlnen are treated with suspicion or hostility; it is all but impossible to find a guide unless the traveler is an elf or a follower of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Blood of Vol]{Blood of Vol}.</p>\n<p>Farlnen is primarily inhabited by elves, along with a handful of eladrin and half­elves. The eladrin arrived eighteen hundred years ago, fleeing a disaster in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thelanis]{Thelanis}; they have fully embraced the Bloodsail culture and married into elf families. Members of other races might be accepted as guests, but there is no place for humans on the Black Isle.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_g0qv2btwy4s","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

The house acts as a managing company, keeping its share of the profits and overseeing the guilds' decision-making processes. Most members of House Orien work for one guild or the other. Nonguild members of the house typically deal with the other houses or the governments of Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Couriers GUILD</h2>\n<p>The Couriers Guild serves both the rich and poor of Khorvaire, though the common folk arguably benefit the most from it. For a reasonable fee, the guild arranges safe transportation for letters or packages. Lightning rail cargo runs cover Khorvaire's major centers and the smaller settlements en route, while Orien caravans serve more remote areas. In addition, the Couriers Guild can arrange express shipping, guaranteeing the fastest service and personal delivery at the recipient's end. For its most exclusive clients (and at its most expensive rates), the guild guarantees safe, nextday delivery of any parcel small enough to be carried by the courier charged with teleporting to its destination.</p>\n<p>As a side service, the guild also employs an elite group of agents who specialize in secure and high-risk delivery scenarios. If the destination is dangerous or remote, or if the item or information to be shipped cannot be entrusted to the rail or the open road, the Couriers Guild has options for those who can afford them.</p>\n<p>Couriers typically undertake a good number of low-risk assignments before they are entrusted with sensitive documents or goods. All couriers undergo a thorough investigation of their character before becoming members of the guild. Those who have proven their worth and are of sufficient experience can become special couriers, taking on high-profile assignments.</p>\n<h2>Transportation Guild</h2>\n<p>The Transportation Guild is responsible for lightning rail, caravan, and coach routes throughout Khorvaire, including the maintenance of trade roads and courier posts. Tariff agreements made with the nations through which its lines run fund the guild. Taxes paid by the settlements where stops are located go toward station maintenance. Passenger fares and shipping fees on the lightning rail, coaches, and caravans are used for general maintenance, salaries, and overhead, and to boost House Orien's bottom line.</p>\n<p>While the Couriers Guild is a valuable part of Orien's business, the Transportation Guild is the house's financial foundation. Nearly everyone involved with house operations works in the Transportation Guild at some point. Piloting a lightning rail is the most glamorous and prized job in the guild, but beneath every pilot are hundreds of guild operatives whose work keeps the rail running. Orien does not make its employment numbers public, but it is widely surmised that the Transportation Guild is the largest guild in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Transportation Guild's teleportation services are typically available only at house enclaves. Once the province of nobles and the dragonmarked viceroys, teleportation has taken on a new significance for Orien in the aftermath of the Last War. In the age of exploration, a new class of adventurers and mercenary heroes often has the need (and the coin) to hire those Orien heirs with the greater or Siberys Mark of Passage. In particular, the greater teleport ability of a Siberys heir allows instantaneous travel from mainland Khorvaire to the wilds and riches of Xen'drik. Faced with the prospect of a dangerous, monthlong voyage across the Thunder Sea, many an adventuring party is willing to cobble together the cost required to teleport directly from Sharn to Stormreach.</p>\n<p>As they did all through the Last War, Orien teleporters continue to do a steady trade with the nobility and the dragonmarked houses. The politics of Khorvaire have never been in greater flux, and the ability to instantly meet with one's allies—or just as instantly send spies into the court of one's foes—is the foundation of the alliances and intrigue that make up the modern age.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>Trailblazers:</strong> Someone needs to lay the conductor stones, identify demi-planes, and plant the runic anchors.

Those who possess Medani's mark can sense arcane and divine power, the taint of poison, unseen intruders, or magical observation from a world away. All Medani heirs train in the use of logic, perception, and techniques for assembling fragments of evidence into a recognizable whole. As allies, they are formidable; as enemies, even more so.</p>\n<p>The Medani alliance existed before Galifar: a collection of families based in the former Medani provinces of what would one day become @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}. Already accustomed to blending into human or elf society, the half-elves of the Medani concealed their dragonmarks when they first appeared. A close-knit society, they were content to use the Mark of Detection quietly, building a reputation as bodyguards and scouts while attempting to avoid the growing conflicts of the other dragonmarked.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} discovered Medani partway through the War of the Mark. At first, it was thought that the Mark of Detection might simply be a prevalent aberrant dragonmark, but that conjecture was quickly discarded. Cannith finally tracked down the elders of the Medani families and convinced them (some say threatened) to take their place alongside the other dragon marked houses.</p>\n<p>Even today, distaste for authority runs strong in Medani, giving rise to aloofness that many dragonmarked ascribe to the house. Medani is forthright in its views on house politics and is an active participant in the Twelve, but representatives of the other houses sometimes claim that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} works against their interests as often as it supports them.</p>\n<h2>Friends in High Places</h2>\n<p>By virtue of its geographic origins and current leadership, however, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} has a close relationship with the Brelish crown. The house is based in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Wroat]{Wroat}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Medani]{Baron Trelib} (NG male half-elf rogue 7/master inquisitive 2) is a long-standing friend of King Boranel. During the Last War, Medani maintained the same steadfast neutrality as the other dragonmarked houses. However, it is rumored that a good portion of the wartime intelligence directed to Breland from its allies in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} might have originated with Medani—the house using connections of Sivis to assist its homeland while maintaining necessary secrecy.</p>\n<p>Though the dragonmarked houses are directed to carry on their mercantile operations at a neutral distance from the nobility of the new Khorvaire, Trelib's close relationship with King Boranel often causes the house to deal more favorably with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} than with the rest of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. Trelib is known to have supplied a number of Medani operatives to Boranel's court, and is also charged with discovering who assassinated Boranel's first wife, Queen Chaseva. Those close to Trelib speak of his utter devotion to solving the murder, but all his efforts to date have proved fruitless.</p>\n<p>Though this close relationship angers many outside @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} (nobles and dragonmarked alike), some Brelish have their own concerns. Within the King's Dark Lanterns, high-placed operatives wonder openly whether Boranel is in fact being played by Medani—and whether Trelib's long years of friendship have enabled him to place deep-cover agents within the ranks of the Brelish court or the Lanterns themselves.</p>\n<h2>Estranged Siblings</h2>\n<p>Though both @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Lyrandar} and Medani are made up of half-elves, little love is lost between the two houses. Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Ghallanda} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Jorasco}, Lyrandar and Medani formed at different times, in different areas, and under very different circumstances. Lyrandar is ambitious and ostentatious, while Medani is focused and withdrawn. The former prides itself on its diplomacy and political acumen, while the latter has no fear of playing favorites.</p>\n<p>Despite their dissimilar temperaments, the two houses have some common ground. A subtle disdain for those who feel entitled to power shows in their dealings with the other houses (particularly Cannith), as does a preference for working with the common folk of Khorvaire rather than the elite. On rare occasions, they have supported one another against initiatives among the houses and movements by the nobility to limit the power of the dragonmarked. Such alliances are short-lived, however, and often conveniently forgotten.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Medani]{Organizations in House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Medani]{People of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani as an Organization]{House Medani as an Organization}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani in the World]{House Medani in the World}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Medani]{Playing a Member of House Medani}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Warning Signs]{Warning Signs}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/symbols/house-medani-seal.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_d88gz4ty0vs","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

{"_id":"xDESz4Lciz081z0Q","name":"Dragonmarks","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Dragonmarks<p></p>\n</h1></div>\n\n<p>A halfling healer touches a dying man; the mark on her forehead blazes with blue fire as his wounds close and vanish. A half-orc bounty hunter reaches out with the power of his mark to find his prey. A human artificer touches a creation forge, and the symbol on her hand flares as the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of these people possesses a dragonmark, a symbol etched on the skin in colors more vivid than any tattoo, magical power made flesh.</p>\n<p>A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the Mark of Making guides the hands of the smith, while the Mark of Shadows helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The Mark of Storms can scatter enemies with a blast of wind, while the Mark of Shadows can weave illusions.</p>\n<p>You can't buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines within specific species, as summarized in the Dragonmarks and Their Houses table. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence, though not every heir manifests the mark.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses. Over the course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts to establish powerful monopolies. For example, only @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar} heirs with the Mark of Storms can pilot airships. This control over vital services gives the houses tremendous power.</p>\n<p>In the past, the dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar. But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the power to enforce its wishes on the houses.</p>\n<h2>All About the Houses</h2>\n<p>Every dragonmarked house has traditions and secrets. Here's a few facts that apply to most of the houses:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Enclaves</strong>. Most dragonmarked houses maintain enclaves in major cities. These serve as strongholds and hubs for house businesses. A city may also have any number of businesses tied to the house, but these are simply providing services and don't have any direct connection to house leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>Names and Ranks</strong>. Any heir of the house who develops a dragonmark is allowed to add the d' prefix to the house name: for example, Merrix d'Cannith. Despite the Korth Edicts' proscription against house members holding noble titles, regional leaders within the houses are called barons. Most houses are led by a matriarch or patriarch, though some are led by a council.</li>\n<li><strong>Emblems</strong>. Each dragonmarked house has an emblem, a distinctive symbol that features on their heraldry, official seals, crafted goods, and anything else that warrants the house's stamp of authenticity. Each house's emblem appears along with the related dragonmark on the following pages.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{The Twelve}</strong>. The Twelve is an organization that facilitates cooperation among the dragonmarked houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriates</strong>. Excoriates are dragonmarked heirs who have been cut off from their houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundlings</strong>. Foundlings are people who have a dragonmark yet have no tie to a dragonmarked house.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys]{Test of Siberys}.</strong> Dragonmarks manifest around adolescence. Each house puts its heirs through a trial called the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys]{Test of Siberys}. The specific trials vary by house, but they place the heir in circumstances where they are likely to manifest the mark, if they have it. About half of the members of a bloodline manifest the mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Korth Edicts</strong>. The Korth Edicts prevent the houses from owning land, holding noble titles, or maintaining military forces (with an exception for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith}). The edicts were established when the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} were united. Today, many in the houses feel the edicts have become obsolete in the wake of the Last War.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmarks and Their Houses</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Dragonmark</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">House</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Race</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Guild Specialties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Detection</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Medani}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{Half-elf}</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, investigation, risk management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finding</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Tharashk}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orc}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Orc]{orc}</td>\n<td>Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Handling</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis]{Vadalis}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}</td>\n<td>Animal training and breeding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Jorasco}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]{Halfling}</td>\n<td>Healing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospitality</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Ghallanda}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]{Halfling}</td>\n<td>Food, lodging, urban information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Making</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{Cannith}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}</td>\n<td>Manufacturing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passage</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{Orien}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}</td>\n<td>Land transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scribing</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Sivis}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Gnome]{Gnome}</td>\n<td>Communication, translation, verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sentinel</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]{Human}</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, mercenaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shadow</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{Elf}</td>\n<td>Entertainment, espionage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{Thuranni}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{Elf}</td>\n<td>Entertainment, assassination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storm</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Lyrandar}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{Half-elf}</td>\n<td>Air and sea transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warding</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dwarf]{Dwarf}</td>\n<td>Banking, storage, prisons</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Agent</strong>. You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Scion</strong>. You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Excoriate</strong>. When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundling</strong>. Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</p>\n<h2>The Powers of the Mark</h2>\n<p>Each dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the inherent powers of the mark. Your dragonmarked race gives you a set of traits derived from the magic of your mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark also fuels or channels some of your spells. Each dragonmark's description includes a list of dragonmark spells that flow from the magic of the mark. If you play a character with the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your dragonmark spells are added to the spell list for each of your spellcasting classes, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.</p>\n<p>You might also consider your dragonmark the source of any or all of your spells or class features. As a cleric with the Mark of Healing, for example, you could say your mark is the sole source of the healing and supportive spells you cast, or your magic might come from a combination of your mark's power and your faith in the gods. As a warlock, your aberrant dragonmark might actually be your fiendish patron, the source of all your magic. These descriptions add flavor to your character but don't change your character's abilities, beyond the dragonmark spells added to your spell list.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the powers of a mark, and these items give the houses much of their economic power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can't be removed—even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity as a character gains levels and uses it to cast more powerful magic.</p>\n<p>While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality. Roll on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Dragonmark Quirks]{Dragonmark Quirks} table for inspiration.</p>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_w20aa8nuflh","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

Work hard and don't complain.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the tales of the Exile, Lanarak and Londurak are siblings. Farmers and brewers, they’re all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they’re both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense—to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there’s a decent chance that if a bartender’s a dwarf, they’re from one of these two clans.</p>\n<p>While Lanarak and Londurak don’t mine metals, both traditionally farm mushrooms and red pudding in deep caverns, and both were drawn into the War Below. Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. </p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"xxhahGmGv8xphIyh","name":"Thelanis","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Thelanis</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Faerie Court</h2>\n<p>Every culture has faerie tales— stories that use exaggeration and supernatural elements to warn children of the consequences of bad behavior or to demonstrate the virtues of society. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} tells tales of the Sleeping Prince, cursed to slumber by a cruel hag until he’s saved by the courage of the Woodcutter’s Daughter. In the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, there’s a tale older than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} itself, in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun’s son with eternal sleep, until he’s saved by humble Toldorath. And the Dhakaani dar have an ancient story about how Hezhaal—a dirge singer who betrayed the empire and studied sinister magic—cast the marhu’s son into a cursed slumber, until he was saved by a simple golin’dar.</p>\n<p>This is just one of many stories that appear over and over in different cultures. The exact details may shift—is the sleeper a prince? The marhu’s son? Doldarun’s heir?—while the thrust of the tale and the lessons it teaches persist. But long before any of these cultures arose, these stories existed somewhere else. In a layer of Thelanis, the Lady in Shadow curses a prince with eternal sleep. She tends a garden full of wonders, and keeps her own daughter hidden in the heart of a labyrinth of thorns. At the deepest level, that is what the fey are: stories. The dryad isn’t a natural spirit; it’s the magic we want in the world when we see a slender tree move in the wind and imagine it as a beautiful person. Thelanis is built on iconic stories, but it’s also the Faerie Court; at its heart, satyrs and nymphs dance in the shadows of the Palace of the Moon, while the archfey engage in immortal intrigues. It’s a fantastic realm essentially built around the idea of adventures, but it’s a deadly place for those who refuse to understand its rules.</p>\n<p>Thelanis is one of the easiest planes for mortals to reach. Just walk through a mushroom ring when Rhaan is full in the sky, or follow the sound of distant music in the forest. It’s not always this easy, but it can be. One wrong step and you could find yourself in Thelanis, retracing the steps of storybook heroes and making dangerous bargains with the rulers of the Faerie Court.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/thelanis-symbol.webp\" width=\"279\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Enchanted Realm. </strong>Saving throws against illusion or enchantment spells have disadvantage. When a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Storybook Logic. </strong>No two layers of Thelanis are exactly alike. Each is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire, all fire damage becomes cold damage. Ability checks using particular skills could have advantage or disadvantage. In one layer, spells that restore hit points might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a potion of healing. But while these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.</p>\n<p><strong>Words Have Power. </strong>In Thelanis, words—and particularly promises—have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with disadvantage on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a geas. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction—though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Time. </strong>Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from layer to layer. It’s possible for adventurers to spend a night in Thelanis, then discover that a year has passed in Eberron. But it’s equally possible for a group of adventurers to find a layer where they save a kingdom and reign as kings and queens . . . only to stumble through a gate many years later and discover that only an hour has passed in their homes. Often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron—either swiftly aging them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades of time spent in Thelanis.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few ways Thelanis can affect the world.</p>\n<h3>Manifest Zones</h3>\n<p>More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it’s rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway—circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times— often when the moon Rhaan is full—and even then, there’s usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won’t stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That’s on you.</p>\n<p>Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word—and if you are false, you’ll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove . . . will you?</p>\n<p>A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location—sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There’s a tale in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds} of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen . . . or until they die.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>When Thelanis is coterminous, new gateway zones spring up. Mischievous or cruel fey may cross over, and it’s far easier for careless travelers to cross over. However, there are always warning signs, and you generally must break some superstition or taboo to be pulled through. Thus, when people know the planes are coterminous, they are cautious to remember the stories and avoid foolish behavior.</p>\n<p>When Thelanis is remote, the effects of Thelanian manifest zones are suppressed. Fey creatures may be temporarily drawn back to Thelanis, even those that normally dwell on Eberron. In general, the world feels less magical.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Thelanis becomes coterminous for a period of 7 years every 225 years, and it is remote for 7 years halfway between these cycles. However, there is evidence, such as beachheads remaining in place longer than usual, that something has disrupted this cycle. This may be a result of the Mourning . . . or it could be that the Mourning is just an easy excuse, and the true story is tied to the schemes of an archfey or a mortal mastermind. Nonetheless, no one knows when Thelanis will become coterminous again—or how long the phase might last when it does.</p>\n<h3>thelanian artifaCts</h3>\n<p>Thelanis can be a source of wondrous magical items. The simplest deal with illusion or enchantment: eyes of charming or a hat of disguise. But any sort of magic item can come from Thelanis—the catch is that Thelanian items invariably have a story attached to them. The berserker axe that can’t be released until it kills someone you love. The dragon slayer that calls out to dragons, summoning wyverns for you to fight and drawing the attention of agents of the Chamber. The crystal ball that occasionally shows glimpses of things you don’t want to know.</p>\n<p>Thelanian items can also hold curses that come with no accompanying benefit. The mithral falcon is a statue that amplifies existing greed. Generous people are unaffected by its magic, but greedy folk feel a growing need to claim the falcon from its current owner. The falcon can start a gang war between criminal organizations, or turn Aurum concordians into the bitterest of enemies. The falcon has no beneficial powers, but its curse can drive a story.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/thelanis-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_vf3731pqxpj","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

Question authority and find your own path.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In Dwarven, <em>sol dorak</em> means “defender of the realm.” While most Mror legends present the legendary Lord Mror as a wise and powerful leader, the talespinners of Solangap say that Lord Mror was an iron-handed tyrant—that the hero Soldorak challenged Mror for the good of the common people, and it was this that led to the Exile. In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.</p>\n<p>This principle is the cornerstone of the Soldorak character. “Power must be earned. The ends justify the means.” They believe the common concept of “honor” is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds. It was this principle that led clan nobles to found the Aurum, originally as a nexus for acts of rebellion against Galifar; today it continues to counterbalance the influence of foreign aristocrats and dragonmarked houses.</p>\n<p>Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of dolaur— symbionts—and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That’s the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe—that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them—but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.</p>\n<p>While it’s home to nobles and soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of charlatans and criminals. It’s a haven for all manner of rogues and warlocks, especially Great Old One warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak folk hero could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and clerics and acolytes are uncommon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">The Ruling Clans</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Doldarun]{Clan Doldarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Drorsnath]{Clan Drorsnath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kolkarun]{Clan Kolkarun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Lanarak]{Clan Lanarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Londurak]{Clan Londurak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Mroranon]{Clan Mroranon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Narathun]{Clan Narathun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soldorak]{Clan Soldorak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Soranath]{Clan Soranath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Toldorath]{Clan Toldorath}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Tordannon]{Clan Tordannon}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Noldrun]{Clan Noldrun}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Clan Kundarak]{Clan Kundarak}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Jhorash'tor]{Jhorash'tor}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_onanq9jq81","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

{"_id":"yhHweclPwQ03Bawi","name":"Daanvi","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Daanvi</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>The Perfect Order</h2>\n<p>There’s a rhythm to Daanvi, a subtle metronome keeping perfect time. If you act without thinking, you unconsciously move to the beat. The streets may be crowded, but everyone walks at the same pace, every foot striking the ground at the same moment. It takes a conscious effort to break this rhythm, change the pattern, stand out from the crowd. Your instincts push you to fall in line, match the pattern, be part of the great machine.</p>\n<p>This is Daanvi, the Perfect Order. It represents the triumph of law over lawlessness, of discipline over chaos. From the perfectly structured insect hives to the inevitable tribunals that judge every mortal action, this is a triumph of order. On the one hand, Daanvi shows how structure and discipline can create enduring systems, and how laws are the backbone of prosperous civilization. On the other hand, it can crush individuality and innovation. It shows that laws can serve justice, but they can also pose an endless series of obstacles, or even be the tools of tyrants. Daanvi encompasses all of these paths. It shows the benefits of law and order—and the risks of taking them too far.</p>\n<aside class=\"template-without-miniatures\">\n<h2>Universal PrOPerTies</h2>\n<p>The impulse toward order affects all creatures in Daanvi. It’s impossible to knowingly lie while in Daanvi, and the effects of random chance are reduced. In Daanvi, all things are inherently reliable—remarkable fortune and bad luck are equally rare.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/daavni-symbol.webp\" width=\"265\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Plane of Truth.</strong> A creature can’t tell a deliberate lie. It can avoid answering questions, or be evasive in its answers, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>Impeded Illusion.</strong> When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>The Eyes of the Law.</strong> When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p>\n<p><strong>No Chance.</strong> The first time in a round (or any time outside of combat) that a creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw (other than a death saving throw), treat the roll as a 10. If the creature has advantage or disadvantage on that roll, it only rolls one die, and treats the other one as a 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Flowing Time. </strong>For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane. So if a creature spends 10 days arguing a case before a Daanvian court, less than a day has passed on Eberron.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>plAnAr MAnIfesTATIons</h2>\n<p>Here are a few ways Daanvi can affect the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>MAnIfesT Zones</h3>\n<p>Manifest zones tied to Daanvi—which are relatively uncommon— often share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Zones with the Plane of Truth property are often used as makeshift courtrooms by local communities, and a number of the largest courthouses in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} are built in such zones. Intelligence agencies are always searching for zones with the Eyes of the Law property. Other zones simply reflect the unnatural order of the plane—crops innately grow in perfect rows, or residents find they are more naturally inclined to follow orders. Unsubstantiated legends tell of modrons appearing in manifest zones, attempting to “repair” any local buildings and redesigning them to match the architecture of the Perfect Order.</p>\n<h3>Coterminous and remote</h3>\n<p>Daanvi has coterminous and remote periods, but unlike those of other planes, these have no obvious effects. Some sages believe it may impact the performance of certain rituals or the creation of eldritch machines, and others try to link the rise of major civilizations to coterminous periods, but any supporting examples could be entirely coincidental. Daanvi is noteworthy for its exceptionally long cycle. Traditionally, when Daanvi becomes coterminous, it remains so for an entire century; one hundred years after that, it becomes remote for a century.</p>\n<h3>daanvian artifaCts</h3>\n<p>Daanvi does two things remarkably well: watch people and punish them. Adventurers could come into possession of an exceptional crystal ball that’s been stolen from the Panopticon, or a set of dimensional shackles lost by an orthon bounty hunter. Another way that people on the Material Plane can interact with Daanvi is through an unbreakable contract. In the Hall of Justice, any two creatures can negotiate a contract before a Kolyarut. The terms are inscribed on an enchanted sheet of gold (worth 5,000 gp) and bound to a marut, which acts to enforce the contract. On Eberron, a powerful conjurer could use planar ally or a similar spell to summon a Kolyarut to set a contract (though they must provide the gold).</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/planes/daavni-symbol.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_lh9t06uejbd","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/11.

{"_id":"yjA3tFNAbkBraijL","name":"King's Citadel","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">King's Citadel</h1>\n<p>The elite agents of the Citadel operate in the interests and at the behest of the crown of Breland. Originally formed as an elite unit of spies and scouts during the Last War, the Citadel became the eyes, ears, and sword of Breland's ruler. The Citadel operates throughout Breland as the ultimate agency for dispensing the King's justice. Local watches and constabularies can call on its agents when a crime or situation poses a threat that spreads beyond their jurisdiction. Agents, on the other hand, can insert themselves into any situation they deem appropriate, since they wield the authority of the crown. The Citadel also conducts operations beyond Breland's borders, gathering intelligence, performing covert missions, and vigilantly working to keep Breland safe from its enemies.</p>\n<p>Part spy, part inquisitive, and part soldier, the agents of the Citadel serve crown and country with heart and soul. The agents have their oath and their duty to guide them, and they are expected to operate always with the good of Breland in mind.</p>\n<p>Today the Citadel's main headquarters can be found in Wroat, not far from Brokenblade Castle. The agency has another base of operations in Sharn, as well as numerous roving agents working throughout Breland and, discreetly, beyond the nation's borders. Lord Kor ir'Wynarn commands the Citadel, assisted by the Citadel captains who each head up a division of the agency. For example, Captain Ellanar (LG female half-elf, paladin 6) leads the King's Swords, a unit of elite warriors trained to undertake special missions. Other divisions include the King's Shields (charged with protecting the king and his closest family members and associates), the King's Wands (an elite unit of wizards and sorcerers), and the King's Dark Lanterns (the intelligence branch of the Citadel).</p>\n<h2>Organization</h2>\n<p>The King's Citadel is a well-known institution formed to protect the royal family. Few know the organization's full purpose, because the secretive agencies at work within it conceal their presence from prying eyes. The Citadel is a powerful espionage and military agency, and its members are equal to any task set before them.</p>\n<p><strong>Leader: </strong>The King's Citadel serves the king and follows his every command. Day-to-day management of the organization falls to Boranel's chief advisor and brother, <em><span style=\"color:#3598db\">Lord Kor ir'Wynarn</span></em>. Kor collates reports from agents in the field, manages royal family security, allocates resources to reinforce local law enforcement agencies, and sends out spies and assassins to attend to major threats.</p>\n<p><strong>Headquarters: </strong>The King's Citadel occupies a black tower in Wroat. The Citadel building is a large fortified structure containing training facilities, offices, barracks, and armories.</p>\n<p><strong>Hierarchy: </strong>The King's Citadel has at least five divisions. A hand-picked captain commands each branch, chosen for his or her work in the field and successes in the organization. The known agencies include the King's Swords, the King's Shields, the King's Wands, the King's Dark Lanterns, and the King's Shadows.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>The <strong>King's Swords</strong>, commanded by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Captain Ellanar</em></span> (LG female half-elf paladin 6), consists of elite warriors trained to operate far and wide on missions in service to the King.</li>\n<li>The <strong>King's Shields</strong>, led by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Captain Sortan</em></span> (LG male human paladin 5), provide protection for the royal family and other dignitaries, as well as overseeing matters of royal security throughout the kingdom.</li>\n<li>The <strong>King's Wands</strong> are commanded by <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Captain Nebik</em></span> (NG male gnome wizard 7) commands. A division of wizards and sorcerers used to provide magical support and to undertake missions that require arcane talents. The agents of the Wands usually work as part of a task force made up of operatives from at least two parts of the Citadel.</li>\n<li>The <strong>King's Dark Lanterns</strong>, one of two secret divisions operating under the auspices of the Citadel, gathers intelligence and performs espionage missions for the crown. <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Captain Vron</em></span> (LN male changeling rogue 8) commands the Dark Lanterns, and he keeps in close contact with Lord Kor and King Boranel about many of his division's ongoing activities.</li>\n<li>The <strong>King's Shadows</strong>, under the direction of <span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>Captain Terra</em></span> (CG female human ranger 9), is the second secret division working within the Citadel structure. The smallest and most exclusive branch of the Citadel, the Shadows only employs the most seasoned, most trusted, and most elite agents in service to the king. An agent of the Shadows always appears to be either a member of one of the Citadel's public divisions (Swords, Shields, or Wands) or as someone not connected to the Citadel at all, depending on the nature of the mission. The King's Shadows do what must be done, with the authority of the crown but also with enough secrecy that Boranel can disavow knowledge of their activities when necessary. Indeed, one of the King's Shadows operates under the knowledge that the crown may not back him if a mission gets into trouble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Members:</strong> Most Citadel agents come from the military, having attained great honors in combat or some other service. A few operatives come from the private sector, selected for special talents or information they hold. Each recruit receives the same training, learning fundamentals about combat, spying, and other necessary skills. During this time, members find placement in a division and move on to specialized training.</p>\n<p>The Citadel often turns to adventurers to fill its ranks. The Dark Lanterns division is notorious for using unaffiliated operatives, often concealing its true identity to keep the new agents honest. Those freelancers who distinguish themselves might be granted an invitation to join the Citadel that they can't refuse.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_8lpbmepmq53","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

For those accustomed to the hard life of the plains, the powers of the mark were a boon. The halflings knew nothing of the draconic Prophecy, concluding instead that the marks were a divine blessing, and that those so blessed were obliged to use this gift to help others in need. The majority of marked halflings chose to follow this call, coming together to form a new tribe. A number of ancient Talenta legends involved blink dogs helping stranded travelers, and the tribe drew on this tradition when they adopted the name of Ghallanda, a Halfling word that roughly translates as “helpful hound who appears where needed the most.”</p>\n<p>For centuries, halflings of the Ghallanda tribe roamed the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains}, offering food and shelter to the needy. They sponsored glorious feasts for the heroes of the plains, standing apart from feuds and tribal conflicts. The helpful hounds were welcome in every camp and assisted people of all tribes.</p>\n<h2>THE RISE OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}</h2>\n<p>Karrn soldiers first explored the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenata Plains]{Talenata Plains} when Karrn the Conqueror sought to spread his rule across all Khorvaire. The Talenta halflings were puzzled by these large and unwieldy creatures, but the Ghallanda tribe had vowed to help all who were in need. Soldiers returned with tales of little people using magical marks to conjure food and castles from the air. These tales intrigued the other dragonmarked families, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} organized a joint expedition that led them to discover both the Ghallanda and Jorasco dragonmarked.</p>\n<p>Despite their altruistic traditions, the elders of the Ghallanda were no fools. Even those who desired to leave the plains and explore foreign lands did not intend to do so as servants. They agreed to work with the other houses, provided those houses would help them find a foothold in their lands. After much negotiating, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} was born.</p>\n<h2>GHALLANDA IN THE MODERN AGE</h2>\n<p>It took some time for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to spread its roots. Many humans considered the halflings to be cousins to the goblins, who were largely oppressed and enslaved at the time. The Ghallanda halflings had often served as mediators in their homelands, and they used their skill and charm at every level of society as they carved out a niche in the young @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations}. During the conflict of the War of the Mark, the Ghallanda halflings proved their worth by supplying and supporting dragonmarked forces in the field. This effort gained them the support of the other houses and secured their place among the Twelve.</p>\n<p>Over the next thousand years, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} spread across Khorvaire, and today it is one of the most trusted houses in the land.

The Zilargo Repertoire Group generally performs works that only interest gnomes, full of intricate histories and a level of detail that audiences of other races find excessive (and mostly boring). Occasionally, they stage a comedy aimed at mixed-race audiences, generally featuring acrobatics and pratfalls. Recently, the famous gnome bard Kessler agreed to play with the Zilargo Repertoire Group, and that has brought more mixed crowds to their performances.​</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_cflz351a55t","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.

Three hundred years ago, a team of Sivis gnomes came to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} searching for this dragon mark.

Though there were only ten dragonmarked houses at the time, the architect and artificer Alder d'Cannith convinced the committee to name the institute the Twelve, based on his belief that there were twelve true dragonmarks in addition to the shattered Mark of Death. Alder was a brilliant man whose works had played a critical role in the War of the Mark, and the members of the committee humored him—though few expected the remaining two marks to appear. (The remaining two marks, Warding and Finding, were not “discovered” until after the creation of the Kingdom of Galifar.)</p>\n<p>In the beginning, the Twelve played a critical role in shaping the dragonmarked houses, but as the houses have grown in power and spread across the land, its influence has diminished. Nonetheless, the institute remains one of the premier centers for magical research in Khorvaire. By combining the skills and mystical talents of the different marks, the wizards and artificers of the Twelve have created remarkable items. It took the combined skills of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{House Orien}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith}, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} to create the safe-deposit vaults that allow Kundarak customers to deposit goods at one bank and withdraw them across the continent. Airships, the lightning rail, even the warforged—these marvels could not have been accomplished without the spirit of cooperation and discovery found among the Twelve.</p>\n<p>Should you rise high in the favor of a dragonmarked house, you might be able to call on the resources of the Twelve. This institute possesses impressive mystical workshops, vast arcane libraries, and the talents of some of the most gifted artificers and wizards in Khorvaire—all of which could prove quite useful to an adventurer.</p>\n<p>In theory, the Twelve is a neutral foundation: a resource serving all houses equally. However, some speak of a secret cabal at the heart of the Twelve that seeks a return to the days when the institute shaped the future of Khorvaire. Such a group might hope to overturn the Korth Edicts and see the dragonmarked houses rival Khorvaire's nations in strength. Only the DM can decide if this secret society exists—and how much power it wields.</p>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_w20aa8nuflh","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/07.

This famous inn truly does offer something for everyone. Rooms range from utilitarian chambers that a traveler on a budget can easily afford to the utterly opulent suites favored by visiting royalty. The top level of the inn consists of four enormous rooms that are often called mansions. The rooms on the levels beneath become progressively smaller and less luxurious. Those on the bottom level are extraordinarily cheap but borderline uncomfortable.​</p>\n<h3>Rooms available</h3>\n<p>The typical room in the Ten Tier Inn is 20 feet wide by 40 feet long. The most sought-after rooms are those farthest from the center because they have windows that look out over the city, and sometimes even balconies that allow guests to hail a skycoach directly from their rooms. The inn has had a problem with jumpers in the past, so every balcony is equipped with a feather fall trap. The rooms closer to the center of the tower are slightly smaller and have no windows, but they cost about 10% less to rent than those on the perimeter.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the luxurious rooms on the ninth floor and the suites on the tenth floor, the rooms in the Ten Tier Inn have identical decor. Tan tiles cover the floor, except for a soft, off-white carpet on which the queen-sized bed rests. A chest of drawers and two nightstands round out the furnishings, and a selection of periodicals produced within the city is placed on the chest daily. The rooms on the two upper floors have unique furnishings that include king-sized beds. ​</p>\n<h3>Profile</h3>\n<p>​In addition to sleeping chambers, the inn has two ballrooms, which can be rented at a rate of 100 gp per night. A catering service is also available for an additional 20 gp. Musicians from throughout the city are sometimes paid to perform at special events presented here. Typically, these rooms are rented on a weekly basis and booked up to three months in advance.</p>\n<p>The room behind the counter houses a walk-in safe to hold valuables (such as magic items, coins, gems, or other small objects) that guests do not wish to carry with them. The lock on the vault can be opened with a DC 27 (dexterity) Thieves Tools check or a special code known only to the inn's management. The cost for use of the safe is 5 gp per item up to 1 cubic foot in volume. ​</p>\n<h3>Inn Manager</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3598db\"><em>​Edram Malthus</em></span> was once known for his excursions into the Mournlands. Edram is a powerfully built man, now in his middle years. He stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and has short-cropped brown hair and sideburns that run almost to his chin. When not balancing the Books of Khorvaire, Edram greets visitors and inspects the rooms. On the rare occasions when he speaks to guests about his travels to the Mournlands, he gets a distant look in his eyes, and his demeanor changes. Some suspect that he was somehow fundamentally scarred by that alien landscape but doesn't want to show it.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_6i6olmfjt1f","path":"Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/02.
