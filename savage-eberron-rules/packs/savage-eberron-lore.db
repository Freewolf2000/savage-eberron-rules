Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers&mdash;anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall&mdash;but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.</p>\n<p>In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.</p>\n<p>There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it&mdash;but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice&mdash;but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.</p>\n<p>Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.</p>\n<p>A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; everyone clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her&mdash;he needs to know better&mdash;but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"3o7AJmuPWXZYibF6"}

The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves' attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves phiarlans, a word meaning \"spirit keeper.\" As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p>\n<h2>AERENAL AND THE UNDYING COURT</h2>\n<p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels&mdash;knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the undying court, the phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one&mdash;bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served.</p>\n<h2>THE MARK OF SHADOW</h2>\n<p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons&mdash;the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>This exodus included the vast majority of the phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>PHIARLAN IN KHORVAIRE</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan's reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p>\n<p>In 972 YK, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries. In the end, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] saw the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and the loss of most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} holdings in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities].</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"4YA6x53hR0qEZce8"}

It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Patrons</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation&mdash;even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play&mdash;there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll&mdash;it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?</p>\n<p>As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.</p>\n<h3>Peculiar Needs</h3>\n<p>There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam&mdash;perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.</p>\n<h3>PeeriNg iNto the Past</h3>\n<p>Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.</p>\n<p>The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?</p>\n<h3>Politics</h3>\n<p>Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations&mdash;especially Aundair&mdash;might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel The Queen of Stone covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>Droaam&mdash;and Graywall in particular&mdash;is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's is a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.</p>\n<p>A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"5UCs4IVkrLBztZcT"}

In addition to this peaceful work, it maintains a massive intelligence network that stretches across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Khorvaire].

However, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism} was a great blow to the house, reducing both its population and the diversity of its family line.</p>\n<p>As such, Phiarlan's ranks have become more open to those outside the dragonmarked families, though only elves are ever considered for membership. A candidate must have exceptional artistic skill or remarkable talent in the arts of stealth and subterfuge. Experts are well represented within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but its most gifted scions pursue the paths of rogue, scout (from Complete Adventurer), bard, wizard, or sorcerer. Phiarlan spellcasters typically focus on divination, enchantment, and illusion magic, which can be used both for the secret work of the house and for the entertainment activities that conceal it.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] by blood or marriage or accepted based on extraordinary ability (at DM's discretion).</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Though player characters will likely be drawn to Phiarlan's espionage arm, the house derives most of its income from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}. Phiarlan entertainers cover a vast spectrum of the performing arts, and a typical Phiarlan enclave has musicians, actors, poets, dancers, and professional escorts available. Such characters are often experts or bards, with the occasional spellcaster versed in illusion magic. Rogues, scouts, and other combat-oriented characters might begin as entertainers, but are often more attracted to the Serpentine Table, the espionage arm of the house.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE PHIARLAN BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>The wealth of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lies in the knowledge of its spies and the fame of its entertainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Since the services of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are available only to those of great wealth or rank, house membership is usually the only way for adventurers to hire Phiarlan spies. The house's intelligence services are normally not discounted (but see Information, below).</p>\n<p>The fame of Phiarlan's entertainers can benefit player characters in a number of ways. First, if they are performers themselves, they can ask the house to help find a local venue and to promote their performances. Even after the house takes its cut, PCs receive a bonus of from 5% to 20% (1d4&times;5) to the income generated by their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance] checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] members can make use of current information uncovered by members of the Serpentine Table in the course of their work. While in a house enclave, a member can gain a +1 bonus on a single knowledge or lore check per day.</p>\n<p>Though characters typically have to pay for the house's intelligence services, a Phiarlan agent might volunteer information to a fellow heir, warning her of a potential threat or the activities of a mutual enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The house can provide routine access to low-level, invitation-only social events, arranging for characters who are not performers to gain entry as part of an entourage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"ACoDYMQ13nLvGEDl"}

Phiarlan entertainers can be found across Khorvaire, from the grandest gala to the homeliest inn. Phiarlan spies are just as ubiquitous, but rarely seen.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is a neutral organization. Though its spies frequently engage in illegal activities in the course of their duties, Phiarlan operatives respect the overall structure of society. Like their ancestors, the leaders of the house see themselves as agents of balance, evening the odds between opponents and exposing conflicts that would otherwise fester and grow.</p>\n<p>The elves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] practice hundreds of different styles of song, dance, and other arts, covering both the ancient traditions of Xen'drik and the modern styles of Khorvaire. Long before the house was formed, the early phiarlans divided the arts into five disciplines, with the greatest masters and teachers of each settling in the five major enclaves of the house, known as demesnes.</p>\n<p>The five disciplines and their demesnes are described below:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong>Memory: </strong>This discipline encompasses the written word, including prose, poetry, and even propaganda. History might be dictated by the victors, but the smartest hire Phiarlan word-weavers to write it down. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven and run by Viceroy Dulaen Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Aundair.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Motion:</strong> These are the arts of the body, including dance, gymnastics, wrestling, contortion, massage, and more. Gifted students of motion are often recruited by the Serpentine Table, their skills adapted to burglary and battle. The Demesne of Motion is located in Wroat, the capital of Breland. It is administered by Viceroy Surael Shol d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Breland.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Music: </strong>The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, including song and the use of instruments. The demesne is located in the city of Flamekeep, under the leadership of Viceroy Kels Tialaen d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Thrane.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Shape: </strong>The discipline of shape covers the creation of physical objects. This ranges from purely functional goods (the costumes, props, instruments and the like required by the performers of the house) to the physical arts of sculptors, painters, and potters. The masters of this discipline belonged to the Thuranni lines, and the newborn house claimed the Karrnath enclave that housed the demesne during the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the Thrane city of Thaliost, but its operations are overshadowed by those of House Thuranni. Currently the demesne is led by Viceroy Idal Tialaen d'Phiarlan.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Shadow: </strong>In its broadest sense, this is the art of deception. This includes the artistic use of illusions, puppetry, and literal shadow plays, but the Demesne of Shadow also encompasses the verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigning emotion, and playing a role. Actors and orators learn their craft at this demesne, and while a storyteller might create his tales at the Demesne of Memory, he learns to bring those tales fully to life at the Demesne of Shadow.\n<p>The first Demesne of Shadow was located in Metrol, but was relocated to Sharn after the Day of Mourning. The current matriarch of the house, Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, resides at the Demesne of Shadow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Phiarlan hydra has five heads, but a sixth is said to lurk in the shadow of the house crest. The Serpentine Table is the effective sixth demesne of Phiarlan, and the espionage arm of the house. The location of the Serpentine Table is a closely guarded secret, and its placement in the campaign is at the DM's discretion. It might be in a major city&mdash;perhaps even in Sharn, hidden beneath the Demesne of Shadow. It could be concealed within a smaller community, or an entire town that exists only as a front for Phiarlan spies.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table, arranging jobs and ensuring that the local heirs of the house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. Active agents of the group are hidden even from this liaison, often scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Agents of the Serpentine Table hold one of four ranks. The least are known as shadows, and often serve simply as observers. Wraiths coordinate groups of shadows, while specters are elite troubleshooters. Ghosts are the legends of the house. Only a handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully guarded. The leader of the Serpentine Table is another mystery left to the purview of the DM. The interests of Phiarlan's spies are represented by the Seneschal Taen Shol d'Phiarlan, but those on the inside know that Taen is just a mouthpiece for the Serpentine Table's true master.</p>\n<p>The Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi lines have the most influence within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but a number of lesser lines are well established in the house hierarchy. Prior to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism], the Thuranni line had considerable power; today, just a few members of this bloodline remain in the house, and they are often treated with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>NPC Reactions</h3>\n<p>To the average citizen of the Five Nations, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is as harmless as it is intriguing. When a house member is approached, he is likely to be asked which famous Phiarlan entertainers he knows. Those who know of the Serpentine Table treat members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] with more caution, whether out of respect (and a friendly reaction) or carefully veiled hostility.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]'s strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is Ghallanda, and members of that house are friendly toward scions and agents of Phiarlan. Members of House Thuranni typically treat their cousins with cool indifference, though some are more overtly hostile. The only true enemies of the house are the Bloody Shadows, who are always hostile toward Phiarlan heirs.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan's HEADQUARTERS</h2>\n<p>The five artistic demesnes, along with the hidden citadel of the Serpentine Table, are the most important centers of house activity. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has outposts across Breland, Aundair, and Thrane. Where it does not have an enclave, it often maintains a presence at the local Gold Dragon Inn, sharing costs and resources with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]. The Serpentine Table also maintains hidden safe houses in cities across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Since the Shadow Schism, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has been forced to leave Karrnath and the northeast in the hands of House Thuranni. To make up for this loss of territory, it has been working to explore potential markets in the Eldeen Reaches, Valenar, and Darguun, with somewhat limited success.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Phiarlan IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Khorvaire's greatest entertainers are Phiarlan elves, or members of other races who have studied at one of the five demesnes. A singer in a random tavern is revealed to be an elf with the silver mask embroidered on his doublet. A noble lord arrives at a gala with a beautiful Phiarlan escort on his arm. The musicians entertaining at a dragonmarked house banquet bear the silhouette of the mask of shadows. A Phiarlan dancer might even be found in a grungy inn in Darguun, astonishing the locals with her graceful movements and shadow play.</p>\n<p>The house's devotion to the arts can even serve as a source of adventure. A Phiarlan viceroy might ask an agent to retrieve a priceless tapestry from the ruins of Metrol, or send a young heir to Xen'drik in search of an epic poem lost since the fall of the giants.</p>\n<p>Characters engaged in intrigue will see the other side of the Phiarlan mask. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] never turns on its own scions or agents, but for a group of PCs not connected to the house, the hydra can be a dangerous foe. As deadly as a Phiarlan assassin might be, the greatest weapon of the house is information. PCs who are dealing with a wealthy enemy might have their plans spied or scryed upon by Phiarlan agents, providing advance warning and knowledge of the party's weaknesses.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"BFGZpz7qqL7JXR1f"}

While the elves are the primary ambassadors of the arts, members of other races can study under Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>ENTERTAINERS AND ARTISANS GUILD</h2>\n<p>This guild is House Phiarlan&rsquo;s public face. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} Entertainers and Artisans Guild is the foundation on which the house's reputation is built. It runs most of the theaters, music halls, circuses (including the traveling Carnival of Shadows), and similar establishments in Khorvaire. Any business associated with the guild (theaters, music halls, circuses, and so on) only employs licensed talent. A character who has at least a d8 in an associated skill can earn a place with one of the bound businesses of the house. A character with such credentials can find employment in any major city of Khorvaire. Phiarlan heirs are among the finest performers in the world, but anyone can be licensed who meets the guild&rsquo;s standards and pays its annual fee.</p>\n<h2>THE SERPENTINE TABLE</h2>\n<p>The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]. The agents of this covert espionage organization are spies, not assassins. Even lower-echelon agents of the Serpentine Table know little of its structure and membership. Its deep agents have spent centuries establishing their covers. It is not a guild in and of itself; few people outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is used. Members of the house who wish to operate their own independent intelligence agencies can be licensed by the Serpentine Table, though the house keeps a close watch on such endeavors.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has a liaison that acts as the go-between with the Serpentine Table, but this agent knows little of the operations in the city; the true spymaster will always be hidden. While it is a simple matter to deal with the Entertainers and Artisans Guild, the Serpentine Table does not advertise its presence. A character seeking to employ the shadowy services of the house can inquire at a main enclave. If the request is worthwhile, it is passed to the Serpentine liaison. When the time is right, an agent will approach the prospective client to discuss the job at hand.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Carnival of Shadows. </strong>The Carnival of Shadows is a premier carnival that travels throughout Khorvaire. It has enthralled people since decades before the Last War. It is a a traveling Phiarlan circus combining illusion, physical arts, and exotic beasts from across Eberron.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/carnival-of-shadows.webp\" alt=\"Phiarlan's getting ready for a show\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"FM5KvQJ7FJG9VaQf"}

Each line had its particular strengths within the broad field of the house's activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the Five Nations. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together.</p>\n<p>The final blow came in 972 YK. The Order of the Emerald Claw&mdash;at the time, an extension of Karrnath's government&mdash;was a favored client of the Thuranni family, as well as the most important espionage-related organization in Karrnath's government. Knight Superior Kadrath ir'Vardikk, a high-ranking Emerald Claw officer, came to Lord Elar Thuranni d'Phiarlan with information that pointed to a Brelish plot to assassinate both Karnnath's regent and its young king. The plot relied heavily on the talents of the Paelion line, the most fearsome assassins in House Phiarlan. Sir Kadrath demanded that the Thuranni line eliminate the Paelions before the assassins could carry out their mission.</p>\n<p>At first, Lord Elar was hesitant to strike against his own house. He first tried to verify the information Sir Kadrath had brought him. What the Thuranni agents uncovered, however, was a far greater threat than a simple assassination plot against Karrnath. Lord Tolar Paelion d'Phiarlan, it seemed, had concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the Last War to an end and gather the reins of power in Khorvaire, not in Breland's hands, but in his own. Part of this plan, Lord Elar learned, involved exterminating the other Phiarlan families as well as the leadership of the other dragonmarked houses.</p>\n<p>Some might have dismissed these plans as megalomaniacal ravings presenting little serious threat. Since they originated in the most fearsome line of assassins in all Khorvaire, however, Lord Elar took them utterly seriously, and he ordered an immediate strike to exterminate the Paelions before Lord Tolar could carry out his plan.</p>\n<p>Lord Elar himself killed Tolar and his immediate family, while the Thuranni agents at his command slaughtered every Paelion within the family holdings in Lhazaar, and every one they could find in Phiarlan holdings across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Outraged at this apparent betrayal, Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi d'Phiarlan declared the Thuranni line excoriate. Defiant, Lord Elar refused this punishment, instead declaring the formation of a new dragonmarked house. The clients of the Thuranni family continued doing business with the excoriate house, and Elar&mdash;now taking the title of Baron&mdash;managed to acquire some clients formerly loyal to the Paelion line.</p>\n<p>To this day, Baron Elar d'Thuranni maintains that he acted out of loyalty to his own house and all the dragonmarked houses, quashing a plot that would have thrown all of Khorvaire into even greater upheaval. There are many sides to the story, however, and&mdash;as in all tales of espionage&mdash;the truth is hard to discern.</p>\n<p>Some would suggest that the Order of the Emerald Claw actually fabricated evidence against the Paelions, bringing some of it to Lord Elar while planting the rest in the Paelion holdings for Elar's spies to uncover. Some further suggest a link between the Emerald Claw's role in the Shadow Schism and Regent Moranna's decision to outlaw the order just four years later.</p>\n<p>Other theories suggest wilder conspiracies. Some claim that human agents of the draconic Chamber helped to bring the schism about in order to fulfill prophetic claims about thirteen houses or the split of a single house. (Many of these theorists further claim that the same Chamber agents are working to prevent House Cannith from splintering for the same reason.) Others whisper that at least one prisoner in Dreadhold is imprisoned there for his role in fomenting the schism. Still others claim that Lord Elar and Baron Elvinor amicably agreed to a split in the house and used a mutual enemy, the Paelion line, as a scapegoat to cloak their true intentions.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth, the Shadow Schism was the most important consequence of the Last War as far as the dragonmarked houses are concerned. Just as the empire of Galifar was fractured into smaller nations, so too the Last War left the dragonmarked houses broken, unsure of their role in the new world and their ties to the new political powers of Khorvaire.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"FVvz5eHTSlXK3n99"}

The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves' attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves phiarlans, a word meaning \"spirit keeper.\" As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p>\n<h2>AERENAL AND THE UNDYING COURT</h2>\n<p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels&mdash;knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the undying court, the phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one&mdash;bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served.</p>\n<h2>THE MARK OF SHADOW</h2>\n<p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons&mdash;the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>This exodus included the vast majority of the phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>PHIARLAN IN KHORVAIRE</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan's reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p>\n<p>In 972 YK, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries. In the end, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] saw the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and the loss of most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} holdings in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities].</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"LaSkr93VkSqlRQgz"}

The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Domain believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.</p>\n<p>Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed&mdash;an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.</p>\n<p>The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find your path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species&mdash;from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.</p>\n<p>All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.</p>\n<p>Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.</p>\n<p>There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam&mdash; the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"M4UoFDwWwtXIeelL"}

On more than one occasion they helped a rightful heir of Galifar defeat would-be usurpers, and if Queen Mishann had called on the house for help, the Last War might have come to an abrupt end. House Phiarlan did good business during the war: Every nation needed intelligence. However, this work put the house under tremendous pressure. Shadowmarked elves from different families often found themselves working at cross-purposes, and some lost sight of their neutrality and developed attachments to a particular nation.</p>\n<p>This situation came to a head in 972 YK, when Thuranni assassins turned on another family within House Phiarlan&mdash;the Paelion line. The few Paelions who survived this attempt at extermination went into hiding. Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan condemned the action and called for the excoriation of the entire Thuranni family. Elar Thuranni refused to accept this judgment, declaring his family to be a new house. After years of argument, the Twelve agreed, and House Thuranni was born.</p>\n<p>This is the official story of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}, but many questions remain. What triggered the massacre of the Paelions? Elar claims to have uncovered a Paelion plot to assassinate kings and dragon marked barons. But there are those who say that both Elar and Elvinor wanted the split, and used the Paelions as scapegoats. If this is true, what could be the reason?</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> For most of the Last War, the Thuranni were part of House Phiarlan. The Thuranni line was concentrated in northwestern Khorvaire and performed much of its work for Karrnath. It worked closely with the Order of the Emerald Claw, and some say that House Thuranni continues to work with the Emerald Claw today.</p>\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>Baron Elar d'Thuranni:</strong> Baron Elar is an enigmatic figure, driven and charismatic. It was Elar who ordered the extermination of the Paelion line, and who forced the Twelve to accept a new dragonmarked house. Always working to strengthen his line, Elar is willing to make great sacrifices to accomplish his goals, and he expects the same of those around him.</p>\n<p>Elar's connection to the Mark of Shadow is exceptionally strong. He is accompanied by two sword wraiths named Wrem and Wrek, who serve as bodyguards and advisors. The origin of these spirits remains a mystery; some say that they are embodiments of the Mark of Shadow itself, made manifest to guide the baron. (These sword wraiths do not have the spawn wraith power, but are otherwise as described in the Monster Manual.)</p>\n<p>The nature of Elar's schemes could affect a Thuranni PC drawn into his service. If you decide that Elar seeks only to expand the influence of his family, PCs might be called upon to hunt down surviving Paelions or to undermine House Phiarlan. But if you decide that Elar has ties to the Order of the Emerald Claw&mdash;or to the Shadowfell itself&mdash;a PC might have to decide whether to embrace Elar's purposes or challenge them.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Guilds and Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>Shadow Network: </strong>Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], House Thuranni combines its espionage and artistic activities in a single guild. Although some heirs specialize in one path or the other, every Thuranni is to some degree involved in espionage. As with House Phiarlan, House Thuranni's covert services are made available only to clients chosen by the house; one can't simply hire a Thuranni spy.</p>\n<p>House Thuranni excels both in the shaping arts and in the field of assassination. Members of House Thuranni are concerned with the prosperity of their house, not with abstract ideals of order or balance.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Shadows: </strong>Although there is a strong rivalry between House Thuranni and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], there is a strict limit to the feud: no assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni, he'll try to prove his superior skills, but he won't expose the rival spy. It's a game. But there is a third player, and it doesn't follow the rules. The Bloody Shadows are the survivors of the Paelion line, those skilled or lucky enough to escape the extermination attempt. Though few in number, the Bloody Shadows are lethal assassins, careful and patient. The Shadows want to make their cousins suffer; a Bloody Shadow might draw out his vengeance against a Phiarlan PC over months or years, causing as much pain as possible before striking the final blow.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p>The Shadow Network has safe houses hidden across Khorvaire, but the major enclaves of House Thuranni are found in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. Since the Schism, House Thuranni has been expanding its operations and has established small enclaves in Q'barra and Droaam.</p>\n<p><strong>Regalport: </strong>The oldest and largest House Thuranni enclave is in Regalport, the capital city of the Lhazaar Principalities. This is the home of Baron Elar d'Thuranni, who divides his time between this city and a smaller outpost in the Dancing Shadows district of Sharn.</p>\n<p><strong>Stonespur: </strong>There are rumors that Baron Elar has been constructing secret enclaves for activities that the Shadow Network wants to hide even from trusted clients. Sailors claim to have seen a black citadel near the island of Stonespur, protected with powerful magic; this could be one of Elar's secret fortresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Tantamar: </strong>This town, centrally located in the mainland portion of the Lhazaar Principalities, is the heart of House Thuranni's activities on Khorvaire proper. The house has established a grand theater in Tantamar, and the finest artists of the Shadow Network perform on this stage.</p>\n<p><strong>The True Shapers: </strong>When the Thuranni were part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], they oversaw the Demesne of Shape, home to the material arts. Following the Shadow Schism, House Thuranni retained possession of the demesne, located in Atur in Karrnath. When House Phiarlan established a new Demesne of Shape in Thaliost, House Thuranni renamed its enclave the True Shapers. It is home to some of the finest masters of architecture, costuming, sculpture, and painting; students come from across Khorvaire to learn from them.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/mark-of-shadow-entertainers.webp\" alt=\"Phiarlan's getting ready for a show\" width=\"871\" height=\"1000\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"Nm7W4RBTtP51Xb4c"}

Dragonmarks normally manifest in response to stress, and each of the houses has developed a battery of trials that are designed to draw out a latent dragonmark. All members of a house bloodline undergo this Test of Siberys during adolescence. Those heirs who don&rsquo;t develop a dragonmark are presumed not to have it, though some do develop fledgling or Siberys marks later in life.</p>\n<p>The Test of Siberys varies for each dragonmark. The basic principles are the same across a particular mark, but different house enclaves and barons are known to put unique twists on the test, thus keeping the young scions from attempting to duplicate dangerous tests on their own. While the Test of Siberys is specifically designed to trigger a mark, it&rsquo;s not the only way to force a manifestation. Any stressful situation might trigger a spontaneous manifestation. An heir of a house could develop their mark before being tested, while a foundling born outside of the house could trigger a latent mark by unknowingly replicating the conditions of a Test of Siberys. Additionally, some records reflect accounts of heirs within the true dragonmarked bloodlines manifesting aberrant dragonmarks, much to the dismay of the House.</p>\n<p>Many of the foremost experts on the Draconic Prophecy, like Professors Caldyn and Ennis, hypothesize that such instances are the design of the larger tapestry of fate, and marks appear in completing the necessary steps toward whatever end the Draconic Prophecy declares.</p>\n<p>In creating a dragonmarked character, think about the events that caused your dragonmark to manifest. Did you undergo the Test of Siberys or did your mark manifest independently? The following list looks at just a few of the challenges and forms of stress involved in the Test of Siberys.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Mark of Detection.</strong> An interview in which a candidate is locked in a room slowly filling with water, faced with two identical subjects and must determine if either, both, or neither are changelings, and the correct answer yields the key to safety. Many applicants manifest the mark simply from the stress of suffocation, even if they fail the requirements of the test. Since that is the true purpose of the test, such successes are praised just as are those who exit the room with dry boots.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Finding.</strong> A candidate must track a designated target, often through the Shadow Marches and, depending on the skill of the candidate, such extended hunting might involve ever increasingly dangerous beasts. In a city, the test might involve tracking a House mentor. In either case, failure will bring shame on the family, and could involve injury or death, especially if the prey gets the drop on a would-be hunter.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Handling.</strong> The dragonmark allows its bearer to befriend monstrosities, and the most common test is to be locked in a small space with an angry hippogriff. Candidates might also be faced with a stampede of lesser beasts, challenged to wrangle a herd of cats, or otherwise presented with a difficult task involving the handling animals.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Hospitality.</strong> The most common feature of the Mark of Hospitality includes a strong power of persuasion, and the Ghallanda trials largely revolve around high-stakes baking tournaments. In these bake-offs, candidates often aren&rsquo;t given all the ingredients they require, challenging the heirs to either find a way to overcome this handicap through exceptional talent with cook&rsquo;s utensils or to convince the judges that the proposed meal was a subpar selection, and the dish presented is more appropriate to suit the pallet given the ingredients, which likely requires the ability to make fast friends.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Making.</strong> The heir is stranded in a junk heap with a specific challenge that will allow them to escape imprisonment. To accomplish this, the heir must either mend broken equipment or use magecraft to cobble together something entirely new.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Passage.</strong> Speed is the defining feature of the Mark of Passage, and the candidates are often pitted against each other in foot races to deliver packages to the administrators containing letters of their success, dodging iron defenders while wild beasts are set after them. Those who fall behind might suffer a mauling. As a final safeguard against the crafty candidate, an heir that takes too long to deliver the package also carries with it the mark manifesting stress of the explosive properties infused within the parcel.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Scribing.</strong> Some enclaves focus on the translating abilities of the mark, creating tests that require an immediate translation. An heir could be placed in a dire situation such as being poisoned, or locked in an increasingly inhospitable space, left only with incomprehensible instructions that reveal the keys to survival. Others require a perfect act of scribing, which some might call forgery, perfectly duplicating a challenging piece of writing, such as a legal document. Failing this test could very well mean imprisonment, should the authorities happen upon such replication and detect its imperfections.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Sentinel.</strong> Similar to House Jorasco, Sentinel heirs are often paired with dogs or other animals. After a year of bonding, the heir must keep their animal companion alive through a harrowing week of unexpected assaults and hidden threats otherwise impossible without the assistance of a dragonmark.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Shadow.</strong> The heir is sealed in a space with a brutal foe and must successfully evade the enemy for a period. Some enclaves prefer to avoid these tests of stealth and instead focus purely on a display of artistic talent well beyond the level of most professional entertainers.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Storm.</strong> The candidate is stranded in a dinghy on storm-tossed water and must make their way safely to land. If the fear of drowning is not enough to awaken the heir&rsquo;s mark, the fear of being lost at sea is often cited as the catalyst to achieve the desired result.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Warding.</strong> A common trial involves heirs being sealed in vaults and abandoned. The candidate works to overcome the locks before succumbing to hunger and thirst. Alternatively, late bloomers might face a dangerous threat approaching in the distance, and the candidate must repair a chamber&rsquo;s locks and enter before it arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"OBuv7aYA4C4TfEyt"}

They have been&nbsp; entertaining the good burghers and hamlets for a few decades. The entire show travels in a caravan of nine covered Vistani wagons pulled by nags. The wagons are gaudily painted and depict the show&rsquo;s performers beneath the legend, &ldquo;The Crooked Kin&mdash; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]'s Greatest Traveling Cabinet of Curiosities!&rdquo; Each wagon has a front and back door opening onto cramped living accommodations inside. They have been licensed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] since the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism].</p>\n<p>The Crooked Kin consists of 13 performers, all people with a variety of physical handicaps or deformities, plus a handful of additional sideshow attractions. Though they all have exotic (or in some cases, frightening) appearances, the Kin are just honest performers trying to make a living, and are concerned for the life of one of their friends. The following people make up the Crooked Kin. <strong>Hap Tarvin, the Flea Man:</strong> A short, hunched man with a distorted appearance, Hap performs with his f lea circus, the Magnificent Carnival of Miniature Wonders. <strong>Kaleb Hesse, the Ringmaster:</strong> An albino man with red eyes and long, white hair that hangs below his knees, Kaleb wears a tall red top hat, a long red coat with gold buckles, and striped trousers. He is the de facto leader of the Crooked Kin. <strong>Lidia Gerod, the Bearded Lady:</strong> Standing nearly 7 feet tall and possessed of a fine beard down to her waist, Lidia acts as a sort of &ldquo;mother hen&rdquo; to the other members of the troupe. <strong>The Pinheads:</strong> Aleece, Lettie, and Poppy are sisters, all of whom havemicrocephaly. <strong>Prince Zar, the Human Caterpillar:</strong> This Mwangi man has no arms or legs. Prince Zar was once enslaved in a Chelish sideshow, but earned enough money to buy his freedom. He joined the Crooked Kin, where he is billed as an exiled prince of the &ldquo;Lost Cities of Darkest Garund.&rdquo; <strong>S&rsquo;jeer, the Vudrani Princess:</strong> Born with four arms, S&rsquo;jeer dresses in exotic silks and speaks with a thick accent, but she is actually from Galt and the daughter of a fishmonger. <strong>The Swarm of Clowns: </strong>These three men, Gerik, Josef, and Tam, each have an extra limb (Josef has three legs, the others have three arms). Besides their skill in clowning, they are also accomplished acrobats and jugglers. <strong>Trollblood, the Giant Man:</strong> A shockingly ugly Ulfen man nearly 8 feet tall, Trollblood entertains the crowds with fire-breathing and his feats of strength. <strong>The Wolf Child:</strong> Supposedly raised by wolves in the Nightwood, this 10-year-old boy is covered in hair. He is unfortunately insane, but the three pinhead sisters treat him like a younger brother. In addition, the show also includes a pair of caged goblin dogs, a morlock, and a giant frog.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"Pt3ts2V2it42jUsz"}

Though there were only ten dragonmarked houses at the time, the architect and artificer Alder d&rsquo;Cannith convinced the committee to name the institute the Twelve, based on his belief that there were twelve true dragonmarks in addition to the shattered Mark of Death. Alder was a brilliant man whose works had played a critical role in the War of the Mark, and the members of the committee humored him&mdash;though few expected the remaining two marks to appear. (The remaining two marks, Warding and Finding, were not &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; until after the creation of the Kingdom of Galifar.)</p>\n<p>In the beginning, the Twelve played a critical role in shaping the dragonmarked houses, but as the houses have grown in power and spread across the land, its influence has diminished. Nonetheless, the institute remains one of the premier centers for magical research in Khorvaire. By combining the skills and mystical talents of the different marks, the wizards and artificers of the Twelve have created remarkable items. It took the combined skills of House Orien, House Cannith, and House Kundarak to create the safe-deposit vaults that allow Kundarak customers to deposit goods at one bank and withdraw them across the continent. Airships, the lightning rail, even the warforged&mdash;these marvels could not have been accomplished without the spirit of cooperation and discovery found among the Twelve.</p>\n<p>Should you rise high in the favor of a dragonmarked house, you might be able to call on the resources of the Twelve. This institute possesses impressive mystical workshops, vast arcane libraries, and the talents of some of the most gifted artificers and wizards in Khorvaire&mdash;all of which could prove quite useful to an adventurer.</p>\n<p>In theory, the Twelve is a neutral foundation: a resource serving all houses equally. However, some speak of a secret cabal at the heart of the Twelve that seeks a return to the days when the institute shaped the future of Khorvaire. Such a group might hope to overturn the Korth Edicts and see the dragonmarked houses rival Khorvaire&rsquo;s nations in strength. Only the DM can decide if this secret society exists&mdash;and how much power it wields.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"RxgKpTVbHcCWfyik"}

But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"</p>\n<p>Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs&mdash; miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.</p>\n<p>While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist&mdash;ground meat made of troll flesh&mdash;that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder&mdash;the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.</p>\n<p>When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.</p>\n<p>Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common&mdash;and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma (Performance) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.</p>\n<p>Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.</p>\n<p>While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in muut or atcha, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms chaat'oor or gath'dar to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use aravaat&mdash;easterner&mdash;to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.</p>\n<h3>Cruel World</h3>\n<p>Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey&mdash;and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.</p>\n<p>Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.</p>\n<p>This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.</p>\n<p>While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish&mdash;for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.</p>\n<p>Every major town has a \"grist mill\"&mdash;a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate&mdash;though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily&mdash;stew, sausage, meat broth&mdash;but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew&mdash; there's plenty more where it came from!</p>\n<p>For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.</p>\n<h3>Wide Monster</h3>\n<p>It's commonly said that Eberron is \"wide magic, not high magic.\" The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society&mdash;communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster&mdash; finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Harpy Song.</strong> The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted \"songbird\" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicine. </strong>The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is \"suck it up,\" but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce troll's blood, it could revolutionize public health.</p>\n<p><strong>Brute Force.</strong> With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"WQ4ZXGLoqv8t58iy"}

Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth&mdash;so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage&mdash;\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"&mdash;adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam&mdash;or is perhaps even an ally&mdash;there won't be a bounty on its teeth.</p>\n<p>While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter&mdash;any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.</p>\n<p>Droaam's main exports&mdash;brokered through House Tharashk&mdash; are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!</p>\n<p>In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the Droaamish Artisanship table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"XlNfLX4d4Myt32ec"}

Most of Eberron sees only the beautiful facade: artists and entertainers, poets and escorts. Only a select few deal with the sixth demesne of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]: the spies and assassins of the Serpentine Table. Phiarlan entertainers can be found across Khorvaire, from the grandest gala to the homeliest inn. Phiarlan spies are just as ubiquitous, but rarely seen.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is a neutral organization. Though its spies frequently engage in illegal activities in the course of their duties, Phiarlan operatives respect the overall structure of society. Like their ancestors, the leaders of the house see themselves as agents of balance, evening the odds between opponents and exposing conflicts that would otherwise fester and grow.</p>\n<p>The elves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] practice hundreds of different styles of song, dance, and other arts, covering both the ancient traditions of Xen'drik and the modern styles of Khorvaire. Long before the house was formed, the early phiarlans divided the arts into five disciplines, with the greatest masters and teachers of each settling in the five major enclaves of the house, known as demesnes.</p>\n<p>The five disciplines and their demesnes are described below:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong>Memory: </strong>This discipline encompasses the written word, including prose, poetry, and even propaganda. History might be dictated by the victors, but the smartest hire Phiarlan word-weavers to write it down. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven and run by Viceroy Dulaen Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Aundair.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Motion:</strong> These are the arts of the body, including dance, gymnastics, wrestling, contortion, massage, and more. Gifted students of motion are often recruited by the Serpentine Table, their skills adapted to burglary and battle. The Demesne of Motion is located in Wroat, the capital of Breland. It is administered by Viceroy Surael Shol d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Breland.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Music: </strong>The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, including song and the use of instruments. The demesne is located in the city of Flamekeep, under the leadership of Viceroy Kels Tialaen d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Thrane.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Shape: </strong>The discipline of shape covers the creation of physical objects. This ranges from purely functional goods (the costumes, props, instruments and the like required by the performers of the house) to the physical arts of sculptors, painters, and potters. The masters of this discipline belonged to the Thuranni lines, and the newborn house claimed the Karrnath enclave that housed the demesne during the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the Thrane city of Thaliost, but its operations are overshadowed by those of House Thuranni. Currently the demesne is led by Viceroy Idal Tialaen d'Phiarlan.</li>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Demesne of </strong></strong>Shadow: </strong>In its broadest sense, this is the art of deception. This includes the artistic use of illusions, puppetry, and literal shadow plays, but the Demesne of Shadow also encompasses the verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigning emotion, and playing a role. Actors and orators learn their craft at this demesne, and while a storyteller might create his tales at the Demesne of Memory, he learns to bring those tales fully to life at the Demesne of Shadow.\n<p>The first Demesne of Shadow was located in Metrol, but was relocated to Sharn after the Day of Mourning. The current matriarch of the house, Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, resides at the Demesne of Shadow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Phiarlan hydra has five heads, but a sixth is said to lurk in the shadow of the house crest. The Serpentine Table is the effective sixth demesne of Phiarlan, and the espionage arm of the house. The location of the Serpentine Table is a closely guarded secret, and its placement in the campaign is at the DM's discretion. It might be in a major city&mdash;perhaps even in Sharn, hidden beneath the Demesne of Shadow. It could be concealed within a smaller community, or an entire town that exists only as a front for Phiarlan spies.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table, arranging jobs and ensuring that the local heirs of the house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. Active agents of the group are hidden even from this liaison, often scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Agents of the Serpentine Table hold one of four ranks. The least are known as shadows, and often serve simply as observers. Wraiths coordinate groups of shadows, while specters are elite troubleshooters. Ghosts are the legends of the house. Only a handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully guarded. The leader of the Serpentine Table is another mystery left to the purview of the DM. The interests of Phiarlan's spies are represented by the Seneschal Taen Shol d'Phiarlan, but those on the inside know that Taen is just a mouthpiece for the Serpentine Table's true master.</p>\n<p>The Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi lines have the most influence within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but a number of lesser lines are well established in the house hierarchy. Prior to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism], the Thuranni line had considerable power; today, just a few members of this bloodline remain in the house, and they are often treated with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>NPC Reactions</h3>\n<p>To the average citizen of the Five Nations, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is as harmless as it is intriguing. When a house member is approached, he is likely to be asked which famous Phiarlan entertainers he knows. Those who know of the Serpentine Table treat members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] with more caution, whether out of respect (and a friendly reaction) or carefully veiled hostility.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]'s strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is Ghallanda, and members of that house are friendly toward scions and agents of Phiarlan. Members of House Thuranni typically treat their cousins with cool indifference, though some are more overtly hostile. The only true enemies of the house are the Bloody Shadows, who are always hostile toward Phiarlan heirs.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan's HEADQUARTERS</h2>\n<p>The five artistic demesnes, along with the hidden citadel of the Serpentine Table, are the most important centers of house activity. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has outposts across Breland, Aundair, and Thrane. Where it does not have an enclave, it often maintains a presence at the local Gold Dragon Inn, sharing costs and resources with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]. The Serpentine Table also maintains hidden safe houses in cities across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Since the Shadow Schism, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has been forced to leave Karrnath and the northeast in the hands of House Thuranni. To make up for this loss of territory, it has been working to explore potential markets in the Eldeen Reaches, Valenar, and Darguun, with somewhat limited success.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Phiarlan IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Khorvaire's greatest entertainers are Phiarlan elves, or members of other races who have studied at one of the five demesnes. A singer in a random tavern is revealed to be an elf with the silver mask embroidered on his doublet. A noble lord arrives at a gala with a beautiful Phiarlan escort on his arm. The musicians entertaining at a dragonmarked house banquet bear the silhouette of the mask of shadows. A Phiarlan dancer might even be found in a grungy inn in Darguun, astonishing the locals with her graceful movements and shadow play.</p>\n<p>The house's devotion to the arts can even serve as a source of adventure. A Phiarlan viceroy might ask an agent to retrieve a priceless tapestry from the ruins of Metrol, or send a young heir to Xen'drik in search of an epic poem lost since the fall of the giants.</p>\n<p>Characters engaged in intrigue will see the other side of the Phiarlan mask. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] never turns on its own scions or agents, but for a group of PCs not connected to the house, the hydra can be a dangerous foe. As deadly as a Phiarlan assassin might be, the greatest weapon of the house is information. PCs who are dealing with a wealthy enemy might have their plans spied or scryed upon by Phiarlan agents, providing advance warning and knowledge of the party's weaknesses.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"a6SNqZDfgfyn1Fei"}

A candidate must have exceptional artistic skill or remarkable talent in the arts of stealth and subterfuge. Experts are well represented within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but its most gifted scions pursue the paths of rogue, scout (from Complete Adventurer), bard, wizard, or sorcerer. Phiarlan spellcasters typically focus on divination, enchantment, and illusion magic, which can be used both for the secret work of the house and for the entertainment activities that conceal it.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] by blood or marriage or accepted based on extraordinary ability (at DM's discretion).</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Though player characters will likely be drawn to Phiarlan's espionage arm, the house derives most of its income from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}. Phiarlan entertainers cover a vast spectrum of the performing arts, and a typical Phiarlan enclave has musicians, actors, poets, dancers, and professional escorts available. Such characters are often experts or bards, with the occasional spellcaster versed in illusion magic. Rogues, scouts, and other combat-oriented characters might begin as entertainers, but are often more attracted to the Serpentine Table, the espionage arm of the house.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE PHIARLAN BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>The wealth of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lies in the knowledge of its spies and the fame of its entertainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Since the services of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are available only to those of great wealth or rank, house membership is usually the only way for adventurers to hire Phiarlan spies. The house's intelligence services are normally not discounted (but see Information, below).</p>\n<p>The fame of Phiarlan's entertainers can benefit player characters in a number of ways. First, if they are performers themselves, they can ask the house to help find a local venue and to promote their performances. Even after the house takes its cut, PCs receive a bonus of from 5% to 20% (1d4&times;5) to the income generated by their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance] checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] members can make use of current information uncovered by members of the Serpentine Table in the course of their work. While in a house enclave, a member can gain a +1 bonus on a single knowledge or lore check per day.</p>\n<p>Though characters typically have to pay for the house's intelligence services, a Phiarlan agent might volunteer information to a fellow heir, warning her of a potential threat or the activities of a mutual enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The house can provide routine access to low-level, invitation-only social events, arranging for characters who are not performers to gain entry as part of an entourage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"hMsNykbzgkJKr5A1"}

A half-orc bounty hunter reaches out with the power of his mark to find his prey. A human artificer touches a creation forge, and the symbol on her hand flares as the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of these people possesses a dragonmark, a symbol etched on the skin in colors more vivid than any tattoo, magical power made flesh.</p>\n<p>A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the Mark of Making guides the hands of the smith, while the Mark of Shadows helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The Mark of Storms can scatter enemies with a blast of wind, while the Mark of Shadows can weave illusions.</p>\n<p>You can't buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines within specific species, as summarized in the Dragonmarks and Their Houses table. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence, though not every heir manifests the mark.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses. Over the course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts to establish powerful monopolies. For example, only House Lyrandar heirs with the Mark of Storms can pilot airships. This control over vital services gives the houses tremendous power.</p>\n<p>In the past, the dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar. But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the power to enforce its wishes on the houses.</p>\n<h2>All About the Houses</h2>\n<p>Every dragonmarked house has traditions and secrets. Here's a few facts that apply to most of the houses:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Enclaves</strong>. Most dragonmarked houses maintain enclaves in major cities. These serve as strongholds and hubs for house businesses. A city may also have any number of businesses tied to the house, but these are simply providing services and don't have any direct connection to house leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>Names and Ranks</strong>. Any heir of the house who develops a dragonmark is allowed to add the d' prefix to the house name: for example, Merrix d'Cannith. Despite the Korth Edicts' proscription against house members holding noble titles, regional leaders within the houses are called barons. Most houses are led by a matriarch or patriarch, though some are led by a council.</li>\n<li><strong>Emblems</strong>. Each dragonmarked house has an emblem, a distinctive symbol that features on their heraldry, official seals, crafted goods, and anything else that warrants the house's stamp of authenticity. Each house's emblem appears along with the related dragonmark on the following pages.</li>\n<li><strong>The Twelve</strong>. The Twelve is an organization that facilitates cooperation among the dragonmarked houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriates</strong>. Excoriates are dragonmarked heirs who have been cut off from their houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundlings</strong>. Foundlings are people who have a dragonmark yet have no tie to a dragonmarked house.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys].</strong> Dragonmarks manifest around adolescence. Each house puts its heirs through a trial called the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys]. The specific trials vary by house, but they place the heir in circumstances where they are likely to manifest the mark, if they have it. About half of the members of a bloodline manifest the mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Korth Edicts</strong>. The Korth Edicts prevent the houses from owning land, holding noble titles, or maintaining military forces (with an exception for Deneith). The edicts were established when the Five Nations were united. Today, many in the houses feel the edicts have become obsolete in the wake of the Last War.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmarks and Their Houses</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Dragonmark</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">House</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Race</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Guild Specialties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Detection</td>\n<td>Medani</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, investigation, risk management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finding</td>\n<td>Tharashk</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orc}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Orc]{orc}</td>\n<td>Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Handling</td>\n<td>Vadalis</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Animal training and breeding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>Jorasco</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]</td>\n<td>Healing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospitality</td>\n<td>Ghallanda</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]</td>\n<td>Food, lodging, urban information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Making</td>\n<td>Cannith</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Manufacturing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passage</td>\n<td>Orien</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Land transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scribing</td>\n<td>Sivis</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Gnome]</td>\n<td>Communication, translation, verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sentinel</td>\n<td>Deneith</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, mercenaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shadow</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.01: House Phiarlin]{Phiarlin}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]</td>\n<td>Entertainment, espionage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Thuranni</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]</td>\n<td>Entertainment, assassination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storm</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.01: House Lyrandar]{Lyrandar}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]</td>\n<td>Air and sea transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warding</td>\n<td>Kundarak</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dwarf]</td>\n<td>Banking, storage, prisons</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Agent</strong>. You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Scion</strong>. You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Excoriate</strong>. When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundling</strong>. Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</p>\n<h2>The Powers of the Mark</h2>\n<p>Each dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the inherent powers of the mark. Your dragonmarked race gives you a set of traits derived from the magic of your mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark also fuels or channels some of your spells. Each dragonmark's description includes a list of dragonmark spells that flow from the magic of the mark. If you play a character with the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your dragonmark spells are added to the spell list for each of your spellcasting classes, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.</p>\n<p>You might also consider your dragonmark the source of any or all of your spells or class features. As a cleric with the Mark of Healing, for example, you could say your mark is the sole source of the healing and supportive spells you cast, or your magic might come from a combination of your mark's power and your faith in the gods. As a warlock, your aberrant dragonmark might actually be your fiendish patron, the source of all your magic. These descriptions add flavor to your character but don't change your character's abilities, beyond the dragonmark spells added to your spell list.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the powers of a mark, and these items give the houses much of their economic power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can't be removed&mdash;even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity as a character gains levels and uses it to cast more powerful magic.</p>\n<p>While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality.

The Lyrandars use their mark to alter Khorvaire's weather and, with the aid of the gnomes of Zilargo, to operate elemental airships and sail the swiftest elemental galleons in the world.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its elemental airships, House Lyrandar is one of the most glamorous of the dragon marked houses, but it is not without enemies and rivals. Pirates harry its trade routes, and House Orien regards transport of passengers and cargo by elemental airship as encroachment on its turf. Other dragon marked houses are starting to chafe at what they perceive as House Lyrandar's arrogance and recklessness. Lyrandar's de facto ownership of land at Stormhome and in Valenar, for example, is more flagrant in flouting the Korth Edicts than the other houses would like.</p>\n<h2>House Lyrandar Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]</h3>\n</div>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Lyrandar Coat of Arms\" width=\"273\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>According to House Lyrandar lore, the Mark of Storm first appeared more than 2,000 years ago on two half-elves, Lyran and Selavash, who saw visions of Arawai and Kol Korran promising that the half-elves would become masters of both nature and commerce. The duo traveled across Khorvaire, encouraging half-elves to divorce themselves from both human and elven society. Over time, the children of Selavash and Lyran&mdash;the Lyran'dar&mdash;became a dragon marked house.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War: </strong>In the early stages of the Last War, House Lyrandar was less involved than other dragonmarked houses, since its elemental airships hadn't yet been invented and the Five Nations had little need for sea transport. But as the war ground on, various governments approached House Lyrandar about using weather control to gain an advantage on the battlefield or to augment farm production at home. House Lyrandar agreed, but limited its manipulation to improving the weather. For the right price, House Lyrandar would provide plentiful spring rainfall or an early thaw in the mountains, but refused to cause a drought or bog down an army in mud or snow. Nations and dragon marked houses paid well for such services.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>Baron Esravash d'Lyrandar: </strong>Within the house, the title given the head of House Lyrandar is \"Firstborn.\" Because she is the youngest leader of a dragon marked house, Lyrandar elders sometimes call Esravash \"Just-born\" behind her back. But what an elder sees as impetuous, a teenage Lyrandar sailor calls bold. Esravash is adored by the rank-and-file members of the Windwrights Guild in particular.</p>\n<p>Esravash's immediate goal is to expand elemental airship service as much as possible, building docking towers in more cities and paying House Cannith and the gnomes of Zilargo for more elemental airships. To finance these plans, Esravash scrutinizes the house's bottom line, and she doesn't tolerate shipping losses.</p>\n<p>Esravash plans to stop losses to the pirates of the Lhazaar Principalities. Elemental galleons are now fitted with catapults, and House Lyrandar's spies are busy following the rumors of experimental, magic naval weapons said to have been developed by Aundair and Karrnath near the end of the Last War.</p>\n<p><strong>Torval Enkiliost:</strong> Torval, dragon marked heir of an obscure branch of the Lyrandar family, leads a shadowy operation known as the Stormwalkers. Throughout the latter half of the Last War, the Stormwalkers smuggled fugitives and spies to Stormhome, where they could attend clandestine meetings and engage in cloak-and-dagger activities on neutral ground. The intelligence that Torval gathered along the way kept House Lyrandar one step ahead of its rivals. Even though the war is over, many still pay handsomely for a secret voyage to Stormhome.</p>\n<p><strong>Solia d'Lyrandar: </strong>Solia is in charge of Lyrandar's affairs in Sharn. Troubleshooting various shipping crises keeps her constantly en route from the elemental airship docking tower at the city's pinnacle to the Cliffside docks at its base. Ever since it became known that Solia was considering new routes to Xen'drik, every elemental airship captain has been vying for her favor.</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Guilds and Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>Windwrights Guild:</strong> Most of House Lyrandar's members work with the Windwrights Guild, which provides crews, dockside support, stevedoring, and repairs for seafaring and airborne ships. Any job on an elemental galleon or an elemental airship is prized over one at the dry docks or in the warehouses.</p>\n<p>The Windwrights Guild also allows independent shipping concerns to pay for the right to fly the House Lyrandar flag and to get shipping contracts directly from the Windwrights. Most independent ship captains consider the Lyrandar flag to be a deterrent to pirates. Some think that it wards off bad weather, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Raincallers Guild: </strong>Masters of weather magic, the guild also includes architects and engineers who construct canals, aqueducts, and reservoirs. Many of the members are constantly on the move, traveling from place to place according to climate and season.</p>\n<p><strong>Sela's Path:</strong> House Lyrandar maintains its own priesthood, venerating Arawai, Kol Korran, and the house's founders Lyran and Selavash. Those who follow Sela's Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran sent Lyran and Selavash their dragon marks to bring unity and prosperity to the half-elf people.</p>\n<p><strong>Lyran's Gift: </strong>The arcane researchers of Lyran's Gift work with House Cannith to make better, faster elemental airships and galleons. At secret laboratories in Stormhome and on islands in the Bitter Sea, they also test magic catapults and other defensive naval devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Storm Front: </strong>This hidden cult holds that the Mark of Storm is a gift from the Devourer, not Arawai and Kol Korran. The Storm Front believes that great bearers of the Mark of Storm live on after death as krakens in the deeps and will arise when called to ensure Lyrandar dominance over sea, sky, and even land.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Stormhome: </strong>Just off the northern coast of Aundair at the mouth of Scions Sound, Stormhome is the house's largest enclave. This weather-controlled island is a private fiefdom for House Lyrandar and its guests.</p>\n<p>In the final years of the Last War, Stormhome was a neutral meeting place for spies and power brokers from all sides. After the war, House Ghallanda constructed several luxurious inns, making the island a popular holiday destination for the wealthy The island is more than a vacation destination, however. Large dry docks repair and maintain Lyrandar's elemental galleons and its fleet of elemental airships. One of the oldest buildings on the island, Slate Keep, is where young members of House Lyrandar learn seacraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Valenar Holdings: </strong>On the plains east of the Valenar capital of Taer Valaestas are a number of villas and small keeps maintained by important heirs of Lyrandar. Some young members of House Lyrandar spend a year riding with a Valenar warclan, and it's not uncommon to see one of the Valaes Tairn working on the deck of a Lyrandar elemental vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharn: </strong>After Stormhome, Sharn is the second-busiest hub for elemental airship and elemental galleon traffic. House Lyrandar does its diplomatic and administrative business in the Dragon Towers district and has several private docks in the Cliffside and Lower Dura districts. But many prefer to conduct business at the elemental airship docking tower in the Highest Towers district, since it has the best vantage point in Sharn.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/house-lyrandar-weather-manipulator.webp\" alt=\"House Lyrandar Storm Caller at work\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"jb71KDyFScgUyEfk"}

However, the path you take to claim that power is very much up to you.</p>\n<p>As a scion of the house, you might choose to be a socialite, taking pride in your house&rsquo;s works and enjoying the fame that goes with them. As an adventurer, you likely seek inspiration for some epic work you have in mind. Performance is in your blood, though, and between adventures you are never far from the theater, the tavern, or any other place where you can regale friends and strangers with story or song.</p>\n<p>If you choose the path of the agent, you serve the will of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}. Though some who know of Phiarlan&rsquo;s intelligence services might call you thief or spy, you know better. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} chooses each assignment with care, and through your work in the shadows, you shape the future.</p>\n<p>A third path is that of the nomad. You respect the traditions and methods of your house and wish to hold influence within it, but you have no intention of working your way up through standard service. Instead, you create your own power base, starting with the members of your adventuring party. You will weave your own web of influence, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} will accept you as an equal in the end.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has few enemies. Barring occasional duels between heirs who have crossed each other, your family&rsquo;s rivalry with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] remains a subtle war. Both houses respect the potential damage each could inflict on the other, and respect their established territories.</p>\n<p>When members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] do engage in combat, they do so carefully and methodically. You study your enemy beforehand, learning his weaknesses and preferred tactics. Whenever possible, you choose the battlefield, picking ground that provides a tactical or psychological advantage.</p>\n<p>From the four-thousand-year history of your house, you know patience. A Phiarlan assassin might wait a month to prepare the definitive situation in which to strike, and like those cold killers of your house, you do not consider honor to be a virtue in battle. It is always best to avoid combat when possible, but when you are forced into it, surprise your foe. Exploit his weaknesses. Do whatever it takes to win.</p>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<h2>Heirloom Performances</h2>\n<p>While @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] long ago severed its ties to the Undying Court, members of the house still hold their history and the memories of their ancestors in high regard. The greatest treasures of the house are the works of ancient artists: the dance with which Jhazalaen Elorrenthi blinded the King of Fire, the song that Maenol sang as the elves boarded their ships in Xen&rsquo;drik, and other epic performances.

The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves' attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves phiarlans, a word meaning \"spirit keeper.\" As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p>\n<h2>AERENAL AND THE UNDYING COURT</h2>\n<p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels&mdash;knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the undying court, the phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one&mdash;bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served.</p>\n<h2>THE MARK OF SHADOW</h2>\n<p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons&mdash;the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>This exodus included the vast majority of the phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>PHIARLAN IN KHORVAIRE</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan's reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p>\n<p>In 972 YK, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries. In the end, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] saw the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and the loss of most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} holdings in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities].</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"q0S3nQPQ0WQv92L2"}

They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment. Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells.</p>\n<h3>Eberron dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls fl.owing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools-such as the lightning rail and elemental airships-require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>\n<h3>Khyber dragonshards&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding-which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleonsrequires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.</p>\n<h3>Siberys dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"ruAlaDR5lpslOXbS"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/droaam/skyline-of-graywall.webp\" alt=\"The Skyline of Droaam\" /></p>\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"uSDm2UmAgEHaHX70"}

For many members of the house, it is the only trade they follow.</p>\n<p>Though stories abound that attest the elves of Phiarlan are spies and assassins, the people of Khorvaire treat these as children&rsquo;s tales. Phiarlan&rsquo;s virtuous performers are known across the continent for their talents&mdash;who would believe that they sneak offstage and kill people during intermission?

A traveling band of scouts and bards raised morale and brought news and information to the scattered tribes. They called themselves \"phiarlans,\" an Elven word that translates roughly as \"spirit keepers.\"</p>\n<p>When the elves founded the island nation of Aerenal, the Phiarlans traveled between the city-states as troubadours and mediators. Sometimes mediation worked, but the Phiarlans also learned the power of passing information to the right people. With the rise of the Undying Court, they served the Sibling Kings as spies in an effort to help maintain order in the land.</p>\n<p>Then the dragon marks appeared. Though their nature was a mystery, it was clear that they were connected to the Draconic Prophecy&mdash;and the dragons had long been enemies of Aerenal. Suspicion fell upon the dragon marked and grew worse when it was shown that the line of Vol (bearers of the Mark of Death) were allied with dragons. Fearful that they might share Vol's fate, the Phiarlans fled to Khorvaire, where they joined to become House Phiarlan. Their artistic skills earned them a place in the Five Nations, and in time the Serpentine Table offered its services to those in power there.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> During the Last War, House Phiarlan served every nation in the conflict. As the war raged on, however, different family lines within the house developed conflicting loyalties and found themselves working at cross-purposes. The resulting @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism} split the house, resulting in the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and the near extermination of the Paelion family. In the wake of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism}, House Phiarlan retains greater resources and better intelligence-gathering capabilities, while @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] has trained assassins and the willingness to use them.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d&rsquo;Phiarlan: </strong>Head of House Phiarlan and leader of the Demesne of Shadow, Elvinor is a bard of exceptional skill.

The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice. As it stands, Droaam has been split into lheshat&mdash;a Goblin term meaning \"domain of a warlord.\" Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.</p>\n<p>For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city&mdash; though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent.</p>\n<p>Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse&mdash;foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.</p>\n<p>In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>The agents of <strong>Katra's Voice</strong> are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.</li>\n<li>A few elite soldiers of <strong>Maenya's Fist</strong> usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.</li>\n<li>The agents of <strong>Teraza's Eye</strong> are sages, versed in the region's history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg&mdash;that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, \"I am Teraza's Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"ygRnfa0o2CWf4m6D"}
