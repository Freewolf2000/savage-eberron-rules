The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild} controls the shipping trade, while the smaller @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Raincallers Guild} has made a fortune through control of the weather. The half-elves of Lyrandar might be farmers, sailors, raincallers, or diplomats serving the interests of the Khoravar people. Regardless of trade, they are united by racial pride and a firm belief in the future of their house.</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE Lyrandar</h2>\n<p>Since the days of Lyran and Selavash, House Lyrandar has been a haven for the Khoravar people. The viceroys of the house actively encourage any half-elves to join the house guilds, and any Khoravar who shows exceptional skill has a chance to be adopted into the house. Members of other races can serve in the guilds, but they are often excluded from holding high office. Lyrandar heirs are strongly discouraged from marrying any but other Khoravar, and in the past, this was grounds for excoriation.</p>\n<p>The majority of the low-ranking members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] are aristocrats, experts, and magewrights, while talented heirs often follow the path of the bard, rogue, swashbuckler, or wizard. Raincallers and members of the organization known as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Sela's Path} can be priests, clerics, adepts, or even druids. Over the course of the last century, a number of heirs have become artificers, seeking to reduce Lyrandar's dependence on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] for the bound-elemental vessels that are its lifeblood.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[world.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf].</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] by blood, marriage or adoption.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The majority of members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] are tied to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}. Whether shipwrights, sailors, navigators, guides, or guards, they treat the sea as a second home. Those heirs who choose not to serve in the guilds focus on the overall administration of the house, often serving as advocates for the Khoravar race. The vision of the Firstborn remains at the core of House Lyrandar, and heirs continue to work toward their vision of a unified Khoravar race&mdash;and, potentially, a Khoravar homeland.</p>\n<p>Though some houses put pressure on scions to become agents, Lyrandar encourages a certain level of independence among its heirs. The house often supports the wayward lives of its adventuring scions, with the understanding that these prodigals will someday return to the fold and put their skills to work.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE LYRANDAR BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>Lyrandar is one of the most widespread houses geographically, and house heirs can take easy advantage of Lyrandar&rsquo;s reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> A member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] in good standing with the house can usually secure free passage on a Lyrandar vessel, provided that he is willing to work during the voyage. If he wants all the privileges and comforts of a guest, or if he seeks passage for his companions as well, he can obtain a 50% discount on the fare.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear:</strong> Lyrandar heirs with enough wealth can purchase mundane ships, elemental vessels, and the equipment associated with either at 75% of normal cost. Vessels available for purchase are typically those decommissioned by the house, and they might not be in top condition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"0kWP6OMwpZdDaC4W"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"10CODGs55WmwuyjO"}

The fragments of history suggest that the final attack that broke the Dhakaani defenses came from beneath the citadel. No one living knows just what lies below the Dhakaani tunnels. Almost all the entrances to the depths have been sealed, save for a heavily guarded passage in Bloodstone . . . the Deep Door. Xorchylic has allowed adventurers to enter the depths before, for reasons of his own; it&rsquo;s also possible that PCs might learn of an unguarded passage to the deep tunnels. What lies beyond the Deep Door remains a mystery. Storytellers spin tales of aberrant legions locked in combat with goblin ghosts and of deep wyrms atop piles of Dhakaani gold.

In addition, new monsters are coming to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall] every week in search of opportunities. Droaam is still a nation in progress.

As such, the Stone Pits are surrounded by a tent town made up of both temporary workers and those refugees who hope to join their ranks.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"27ukrlcb3OfZKLHm"}

However, the path you take to claim that power is very much up to you.</p>\n<p>As a scion of the house, you might choose to be a socialite, taking pride in your house&rsquo;s works and enjoying the fame that goes with them. As an adventurer, you likely seek inspiration for some epic work you have in mind. Performance is in your blood, though, and between adventures you are never far from the theater, the tavern, or any other place where you can regale friends and strangers with story or song.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/phiarlan-illusionist.webp\" alt=\"A member of House Phiarlan\" width=\"318\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose the path of the agent, you serve the will of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}. Though some who know of Phiarlan&rsquo;s intelligence services might call you thief or spy, you know better. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} chooses each assignment with care, and through your work in the shadows, you shape the future.</p>\n<p>A third path is that of the nomad. You respect the traditions and methods of your house and wish to hold influence within it, but you have no intention of working your way up through standard service. Instead, you create your own power base, starting with the members of your adventuring party. You will weave your own web of influence, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} will accept you as an equal in the end.</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has few enemies. Barring occasional duels between heirs who have crossed each other, your family&rsquo;s rivalry with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] remains a subtle war. Both houses respect the potential damage each could inflict on the other, and respect their established territories.</p>\n<p>When members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] do engage in combat, they do so carefully and methodically. You study your enemy beforehand, learning his weaknesses and preferred tactics. Whenever possible, you choose the battlefield, picking ground that provides a tactical or psychological advantage.</p>\n<p>From the four-thousand-year history of your house, you know patience. A Phiarlan assassin might wait a month to prepare the definitive situation in which to strike, and like those cold killers of your house, you do not consider honor to be a virtue in battle. It is always best to avoid combat when possible, but when you are forced into it, surprise your foe. Exploit his weaknesses. Do whatever it takes to win.</p>\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<h2>Heirloom Performances</h2>\n<p>While @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] long ago severed its ties to the Undying Court, members of the house still hold their history and the memories of their ancestors in high regard. The greatest treasures of the house are the works of ancient artists: the dance with which Jhazalaen Elorrenthi blinded the King of Fire, the song that Maenol sang as the elves boarded their ships in Xen&rsquo;drik, and other epic performances. One of the greatest honors any elf can receive is the right to perform one of these heirloom works. Each is incredibly hard to master, and requires intensive training and the study of ancient tomes. Traditionally, the bearer of an heirloom performance chooses his successor, but should he die without designating an heir, the council of the appropriate house demesne selects a new elf to perform the art. Stories circulate of unworthy heirs assassinated by demesne councils in order for an heirloom performance to be transferred to a superior artist, but these have never been substantiated.</p>\n<p>An elf known to be the rightful enactor of an heirloom performance receives a +2 bonus on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion] checks involving members of his dragonmarked house. Teaching an heirloom performance to an unworthy pupil is a terrible crime, and both master and student could face censure or worse.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>In the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, talent rises to the top. Skill in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance] and an aptitude for magic are the pillars of a career with the guild, but it takes more than a single performance to earn the top spot in a theatrical company. Repeated success is necessary in order for the house to invest resources in promoting you. As an adventuring entertainer, your life might not put you on the fast track to house leadership, but you could seek the right to carry one of the heirloom performances of the house (see the sidebar).</p>\n<p>The life of an entertainer easily suits a bard, but other adventurers are more likely to be drawn to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}. Children of the house play games of intrigue and deception, and the lessons of your youth remain with you. As you undertake missions for the house, you receive ongoing training in the silent arts. Beyond this, the house can provide you with insight into the secret struggles taking place in the shadows across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], you are taught to be ruthless and expedient when a mission requires it. You are trained to search for the secrets in any situation, since any piece of knowledge might someday prove valuable.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>Should you serve the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, your adventuring companions are seen by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] as an extension of you&mdash;a tool you are expected to mold and use for the benefit of the house. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] excels at magical surveillance, and you will never undertake a mission that could be accomplished by the simple use of scrying. As a low-level agent, you might be sent on so-called shadowbait missions, following a target or penetrating an unexplored location to serve as an anchor for magical observation. If you are especially talented, you might be sent to steal a lock of hair from a target the house wishes to spy upon, or to plant a shadow eye. Missions in the service of the house and its clients could set you against kings, dragonmarked viceroys, masterminds of the Aurum, or even the Lords of Dust.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has no special dispensation to break the law, and agents captured while engaged in illegal activities suffer the consequences. Serpentine liaisons require full disclosure about the reasons driving an assignment. Assassination requires excellent justification, and the house never kills or kidnaps a client in good standing&mdash;one of the reasons rulers prefer to work with the house instead of against it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"4idUfEsBPdCRMx7l"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"5SCXLOSO9NwAV2rB"}

Lyrandar's de facto ownership of land at Stormhome and in Valenar, for example, is more flagrant in flouting the Korth Edicts than the other houses would like.</p>\n<h2>House Lyrandar Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Lyrandar]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Legacy of the Firstborn]</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Lyrandar Coat of Arms\" width=\"273\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>According to House Lyrandar lore, the Mark of Storm first appeared more than 2,000 years ago on two half-elves, Lyran and Selavash, who saw visions of Arawai and Kol Korran promising that the half-elves would become masters of both nature and commerce. The duo traveled across Khorvaire, encouraging half-elves to divorce themselves from both human and elven society. Over time, the children of Selavash and Lyran&mdash;the Lyran'dar&mdash;became a dragon marked house.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War: </strong>In the early stages of the Last War, House Lyrandar was less involved than other dragonmarked houses, since its elemental airships hadn't yet been invented and the Five Nations had little need for sea transport. But as the war ground on, various governments approached House Lyrandar about using weather control to gain an advantage on the battlefield or to augment farm production at home. House Lyrandar agreed, but limited its manipulation to improving the weather. For the right price, House Lyrandar would provide plentiful spring rainfall or an early thaw in the mountains, but refused to cause a drought or bog down an army in mud or snow. Nations and dragon marked houses paid well for such services.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>Baron Esravash d'Lyrandar: </strong>She is the youngest leader of a dragon marked house and is adored by the rank-and-file members of the Windwrights Guild in particular.</p>\n<p><strong>Torval Enkiliost:</strong> Torval leads a shadowy operation known as the Stormwalkers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Solia d'Lyrandar: </strong>Solia is in charge of Lyrandar's affairs in Sharn.&nbsp;</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p><strong>Stormhome: </strong>Just off the northern coast of Aundair at the mouth of Scions Sound, Stormhome is the house's largest enclave. This weather-controlled island is a private fiefdom for House Lyrandar and its guests.</p>\n<p>In the final years of the Last War, Stormhome was a neutral meeting place for spies and power brokers from all sides. After the war, House Ghallanda constructed several luxurious inns, making the island a popular holiday destination for the wealthy The island is more than a vacation destination, however. Large dry docks repair and maintain Lyrandar's elemental galleons and its fleet of elemental airships. One of the oldest buildings on the island, Slate Keep, is where young members of House Lyrandar learn seacraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Valenar Holdings: </strong>On the plains east of the Valenar capital of Taer Valaestas are a number of villas and small keeps maintained by important heirs of Lyrandar. Some young members of House Lyrandar spend a year riding with a Valenar warclan, and it's not uncommon to see one of the Valaes Tairn working on the deck of a Lyrandar elemental vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharn: </strong>After Stormhome, Sharn is the second-busiest hub for elemental airship and elemental galleon traffic. House Lyrandar does its diplomatic and administrative business in the Dragon Towers district and has several private docks in the Cliffside and Lower Dura districts. But many prefer to conduct business at the elemental airship docking tower in the Highest Towers district, since it has the best vantage point in Sharn.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/house-lyrandar-weather-manipulator.webp\" alt=\"House Lyrandar Storm Caller at work\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"5eIYkauXreCmSazp"}

The wind is your ally, the sea your dominion. The Last War shattered @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]{Orien} trade routes and devastated @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith], but your people are stronger than ever. With the development of the airship, you have risen from the seas to claim the sky.</p>\n<p>Racial identity is an important part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]. In a world where nationality and faith often take precedence over race, your family has woven all three together. You have been taught that the Khoravar are a blessed people with a grand future, and that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] lies at the center of this destiny. Humans came from Sarlona, elves from Aerenal. Your kind are the true children of Khorvaire, and the world is yours.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/lyrandar-ship-pilot.webp\" alt=\"A member of House Lyrandar\" width=\"251\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>For those in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}, the connection to the sea is always strong.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>As a Lyrandar heir, you take a creative approach to conflict. Lyrandar swashbucklers love dueling and swordplay, but it is often far more effective to use control weather to sink an opponent's ship rather than face him in personal combat. Battle is never a game, though. You strike decisively, whether you employ magic, a weapon, or clever diplomacy. If you can redirect the hostility of two different foes at each other instead of at you, so much the better.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>Whether you were born into Lyrandar or adopted by the house, your rank is determined by your service to the house, service to the guilds, and service to the Khoravar race. Though the swiftest way to earn the respect of the viceroys is by serving as an agent of the house, young Khoravar are often encouraged to wander and learn the ways of the world. Sail the seas, see distant lands, and whenever possible, serve your people in the process. The knowledge you acquire and the contacts you make will serve the house in time.</p>\n<p>Many Lyrandar viceroys are middleaged or older, and the general philosophy of the house is to leave administration to those seasoned by work and the world. You are young, so enjoy your youth. The house will come to you if it has a task to be performed, and your service will be remembered when the time comes.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] engages in any number of schemes. As an heir of the house, you could find yourself mediating talks between Valenar elves and Karrn soldiers. You might be sent to hunt pirates in the Lhazaar Sea, or to track down an artifact in Xen'drik that might be the key to a superior bound-elemental design. Perhaps you will need to locate, salvage, and destroy a prototype airship lost in the Mournland. Though these are challenging tasks, your dedication to your house could also be tested by darker deeds. A renegade artificer perfecting the means to control an elemental vessel without a dragonmark is a danger to Lyrandar's future. Lyrandar's future is your future, and you know what you must do.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"7RCoBGtVyL7NVXpX"}

A traveling band of scouts and bards raised morale and brought news and information to the scattered tribes. They called themselves \"phiarlans,\" an Elven word that translates roughly as \"spirit keepers.\"</p>\n<p>When the elves founded the island nation of Aerenal, the Phiarlans traveled between the city-states as troubadours and mediators. Sometimes mediation worked, but the Phiarlans also learned the power of passing information to the right people. With the rise of the Undying Court, they served the Sibling Kings as spies in an effort to help maintain order in the land.</p>\n<p>Then the dragon marks appeared. Though their nature was a mystery, it was clear that they were connected to the Draconic Prophecy&mdash;and the dragons had long been enemies of Aerenal. Suspicion fell upon the dragon marked and grew worse when it was shown that the line of Vol (bearers of the Mark of Death) were allied with dragons. Fearful that they might share Vol's fate, the Phiarlans fled to Khorvaire, where they joined to become House Phiarlan. Their artistic skills earned them a place in the Five Nations, and in time the Serpentine Table offered its services to those in power there.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> During the Last War, House Phiarlan served every nation in the conflict.

It runs most of the theaters, music halls, circuses (including the traveling Carnival of Shadows), and similar establishments in Khorvaire. Any business associated with the guild (theaters, music halls, circuses, and so on) only employs licensed talent. A character who has at least a d8 in an associated skill can earn a place with one of the bound businesses of the house. A character with such credentials can find employment in any major city of Khorvaire. Phiarlan heirs are among the finest performers in the world, but anyone can be licensed who meets the guild&rsquo;s standards and pays its annual fee.</p>\n<h2>THE SERPENTINE TABLE</h2>\n<p>The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]. The agents of this covert espionage organization are spies, not assassins. Even lower-echelon agents of the Serpentine Table know little of its structure and membership. Its deep agents have spent centuries establishing their covers. It is not a guild in and of itself; few people outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is used. Members of the house who wish to operate their own independent intelligence agencies can be licensed by the Serpentine Table, though the house keeps a close watch on such endeavors.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has a liaison that acts as the go-between with the Serpentine Table, but this agent knows little of the operations in the city; the true spymaster will always be hidden. While it is a simple matter to deal with the Entertainers and Artisans Guild, the Serpentine Table does not advertise its presence. A character seeking to employ the shadowy services of the house can inquire at a main enclave. If the request is worthwhile, it is passed to the Serpentine liaison. When the time is right, an agent will approach the prospective client to discuss the job at hand.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Carnival of Shadows. </strong>The Carnival of Shadows is a premier carnival that travels throughout Khorvaire. It has enthralled people since decades before the Last War. It is a a traveling Phiarlan circus combining illusion, physical arts, and exotic beasts from across Eberron.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/carnival-of-shadows.webp\" alt=\"Phiarlan's getting ready for a show\" /></div>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Shadows.</strong>&nbsp;Although there is a strong rivalry between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], there is a strict limit to the feud: no assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni, he'll try to prove his superior skills, but he won't expose the rival spy. It's a game. But there is a third player, and it doesn't follow the rules. The Bloody Shadows are the survivors of the Paelion line, those skilled or lucky enough to escape the extermination attempt.

Like their cousins in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], they use the powers of the mark for entertainment and espionage, but the houses have as many differences between them as similarities. Where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] sees itself as an agent of balance, the Thuranni are driven by a sense of destiny. Forty millennia after their flight from Xen'drik, the families of the house still seek purpose, and the secrets they uncover are fragments of a puzzle of fate that has yet to be assembled. This drive is epitomized by the Dragon's Path, an organization dedicated to discovering the secrets of the draconic Prophecy.</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE THURANNI</h2>\n<p>By virtue of its young age and dark business, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] is a remarkably guarded organization. Where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] found it necessary to open up while rebuilding after the Shadow Schism, the heirs of Thuranni have sealed their operations tightly. The house intends to concentrate on solidifying its power base for the time being, rather than embracing new and potentially troublesome members. At the same time, the house is obliged to accept foundlings and other legitimate heirs (if only to prevent Phiarlan from snapping them up), but such members are always watched closely.</p>\n<p>Experts are common in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni], as are rogues, scouts (from Complete Adventurer), and bards. The house seeks to fill its ranks with as wide a membership as possible, and its special operatives often have levels in sorcerer, wizard, urban ranger (from Unearthed Arcana), or assassin.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf].</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] by blood or marriage or accepted based on extraordinary ability (at DM's discretion).</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Unlike their cousins in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], a majority of Thuranni artists are not performers but artisans. Masters of the Demesne of Shape, the Thuranni are some of the most gifted architects, painters, and sculptors in the world. This is not to say that no actors, dancers, or musicians are found within the house, but many of those pursue the fine arts as well.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE THURANNI BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>As grim as it sounds, the greatest advantage to being a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] might be that no heir of Thuranni will accept a job (whether simple espionage or a contract for assassination) that targets or involves another member of the house.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics: </strong>The operations of the Shadow Network are more tightly controlled than those of any other guild in Khorvaire, and membership in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] is the only way for rank-and-file adventurers to hire Thuranni agents. The house's intelligence services are normally not discounted (but see Information, below).</p>\n<p>Artists of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] who wish a gallery display of their work can call upon the house for assistance. In addition, the art produced by Thuranni heirs tends to sell faster and at a higher rate than equivalent work by other artists. Thuranni characters receive a bonus of 5%&ndash;20% (1d4&times;5) to the income generated by their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Crafting] checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Information: </strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] members can make use of current information uncovered by members of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} in the course of their work.

He realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the other, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. From the moment young Galifar stood on the banks of Scions Sound and looked upon the mysterious island that rested just out of reach of the Five Nations, he knew that the island would play an important role in the realization of his dream of unification. On this island he would build his capital&mdash;Thronehold.</p>\n<p>Prior to Galifar, the island was considered to be haunted, a place of the old ways of Khorvaire. That reputation, and its location, made it the perfect place for Galifar's purposes. The great castle Thronehold became a shining symbol of the kingdom, and the island around it developed into a wondrous showcase for the realm. It remained so until the Last War, when it became a reminder of things lost.</p>\n<p>After Jarot's death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle of Thronehold were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect and maintain the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the united kingdom. The town of Throneport, a support community in the shadow of the castle, mutated as the Last War progressed. It became a place for dissidents, spies, criminals, and mercenaries, and the once opulent and safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without law or allegiance to any single nation.</p>\n<p>This neutrality has served Throneport well; by 975 YK it had grown into a small city in which all of the nations and dragonmarked houses had at least a small presence, turning it into a hotbed of international intrigue. The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified this position, establishing the city of Throneport as a multinational province under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"GASnZbHw77VXoozA"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"HNeCmP0BzJW1JO8Y"}

The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves' attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves phiarlans, a word meaning \"spirit keeper.\" As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p>\n<h2>AERENAL AND THE UNDYING COURT</h2>\n<p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels&mdash;knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the undying court, the phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one&mdash;bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served.</p>\n<h2>THE MARK OF SHADOW</h2>\n<p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons&mdash;the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>This exodus included the vast majority of the phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>PHIARLAN IN KHORVAIRE</h2>\n<p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan's} knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan's reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p>\n<p>In 972 YK, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries. In the end, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] saw the creation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and the loss of most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan's} holdings in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities].</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"IP1jLlJWgwNvaUkZ"}

Each line had its particular strengths within the broad field of the house's activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the Five Nations. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together.</p>\n<p>The final blow came in 972 YK. The Order of the Emerald Claw&mdash;at the time, an extension of Karrnath's government&mdash;was a favored client of the Thuranni family, as well as the most important espionage-related organization in Karrnath's government. Knight Superior Kadrath ir'Vardikk, a high-ranking Emerald Claw officer, came to Lord Elar Thuranni d'Phiarlan with information that pointed to a Brelish plot to assassinate both Karnnath's regent and its young king. The plot relied heavily on the talents of the Paelion line, the most fearsome assassins in House Phiarlan. Sir Kadrath demanded that the Thuranni line eliminate the Paelions before the assassins could carry out their mission.</p>\n<p>At first, Lord Elar was hesitant to strike against his own house. He first tried to verify the information Sir Kadrath had brought him. What the Thuranni agents uncovered, however, was a far greater threat than a simple assassination plot against Karrnath. Lord Tolar Paelion d'Phiarlan, it seemed, had concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the Last War to an end and gather the reins of power in Khorvaire, not in Breland's hands, but in his own. Part of this plan, Lord Elar learned, involved exterminating the other Phiarlan families as well as the leadership of the other dragonmarked houses.</p>\n<p>Some might have dismissed these plans as megalomaniacal ravings presenting little serious threat. Since they originated in the most fearsome line of assassins in all Khorvaire, however, Lord Elar took them utterly seriously, and he ordered an immediate strike to exterminate the Paelions before Lord Tolar could carry out his plan.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/assassination-of-paelion-family.webp\" alt=\"Paelion's family is assassinated.\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" /></div>\n<p>Lord Elar himself killed Tolar and his immediate family, while the Thuranni agents at his command slaughtered every Paelion within the family holdings in Lhazaar, and every one they could find in Phiarlan holdings across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Outraged at this apparent betrayal, Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi d'Phiarlan declared the Thuranni line excoriate. Defiant, Lord Elar refused this punishment, instead declaring the formation of a new dragonmarked house. The clients of the Thuranni family continued doing business with the excoriate house, and Elar&mdash;now taking the title of Baron&mdash;managed to acquire some clients formerly loyal to the Paelion line.</p>\n<p>To this day, Baron Elar d'Thuranni maintains that he acted out of loyalty to his own house and all the dragonmarked houses, quashing a plot that would have thrown all of Khorvaire into even greater upheaval. There are many sides to the story, however, and&mdash;as in all tales of espionage&mdash;the truth is hard to discern.</p>\n<p>Some would suggest that the Order of the Emerald Claw actually fabricated evidence against the Paelions, bringing some of it to Lord Elar while planting the rest in the Paelion holdings for Elar's spies to uncover. Some further suggest a link between the Emerald Claw's role in the Shadow Schism and Regent Moranna's decision to outlaw the order just four years later.</p>\n<p>Other theories suggest wilder conspiracies. Some claim that human agents of the draconic Chamber helped to bring the schism about in order to fulfill prophetic claims about thirteen houses or the split of a single house. (Many of these theorists further claim that the same Chamber agents are working to prevent @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] from splintering for the same reason.) Others whisper that at least one prisoner in Dreadhold is imprisoned there for his role in fomenting the schism. Still others claim that Lord Elar and Baron Elvinor amicably agreed to a split in the house and used a mutual enemy, the Paelion line, as a scapegoat to cloak their true intentions.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth, the Shadow Schism was the most important consequence of the Last War as far as the dragonmarked houses are concerned. Just as the empire of Galifar was fractured into smaller nations, so too the Last War left the dragonmarked houses broken, unsure of their role in the new world and their ties to the new political powers of Khorvaire.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/mark-of-shadow.webp","_id":"J7UUWmO5zHshBvuD"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"LUIuZYixT1heX42W"}

However, by virtue of its influence on agriculture, the smaller Raincallers Guild arguably has a larger impact on life in Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>THE RAINCALLERS GUILD</h2>\n<p>A character with the Mark of Storm can summon rain to save farmers from drought or keep a hurricane from devastating a coastal city. The Raincallers Guild has devoted centuries to the development of irrigation systems, dams, canals, levees, and reservoirs to help control the forces of nature. The unmarked members of the guild focus on these services.</p>\n<p>In addition, Raincallers often serve as traveling emissaries of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar], and are trained in the arts of diplomacy. Large cities often have Raincaller outposts, but the guild also maintains a corps of wanderers who travel regular circuits throughout the agricultural regions of the Five Nations.</p>\n<h2>THE WINDWRIGHTS GUILD</h2>\n<p>The Windwrights Guild dominates the shipping trade. The core fleet of the guild is made up of the elementalbound vessels and airships of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar], crewed by heirs of the house and providing speedy transport by water or air. Most of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar's] members work with the Windwrights Guild, which provides crews, dockside support, stevedoring, and repairs for seafaring and airborne ships. However, the vast majority of the guild is composed of independent captains who need not be heirs of the house, or even half-elves. To earn the flag of the Windwrights Guild, a captain must pass regular inspections and pay house dues. In exchange, the guild connects him with customs and cargo.</p>\n<p>Most independent ship captains consider the Lyrandar flag to be a deterrent to pirates. However, common belief holds that captains who choose to work outside the guild are likely to suffer &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; ranging from deadly weather to sabotage or piracy. Regardless of whether Lyrandar truly engages in such sinister practices, the rumor alone is enough to convince prospective clients to rely on guild shipping, forcing most captains to work within the guild. The sailors of the Lhazaar Principalities are a notable exception to this rule, and there has long been tension between the Windwrights and the eastern sea lords.</p>\n<h2>Sela's Path</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] maintains its own priesthood, venerating Arawai, Kol Korran, and the house's founders Lyran and Selavash. Those who follow Sela's Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran sent Lyran and Selavash their dragon marks to bring unity and prosperity to the half-elf people. Its adherents maintain that the souls of the firstborn serve as intermediaries between the Khoravar and the Sovereign Host, just as Tira Miron is said to speak for the Silver Flame.</p>\n<h2>Lyran's Gift</h2>\n<p>The arcane researchers of Lyran's Gift work with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{the Twelve} to make better, faster elemental airships and galleons. At secret laboratories in Stormhome and on islands in the Bitter Sea, they also test magic catapults and other defensive naval devices.</p>\n<h2>Storm Front</h2>\n<p>The Storm Front is rumored to be a cult operating within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of Arawai and Kol Korran but the mark of the Devourer. Cult members maintain that the greatest members of the house live on as krakens in the deep, and that these immortal elders guide the Storm Front through visions. The Storm Front believes that the power of the Mark of Storm was meant to be used for destruction, and that the Khoravar should seize dominion through force, not wait for their time to come. Darker tales suggest that Esravash is just a figure head or a dupe, and that the Storm Front is the true power guiding House Lyrandar. According to these rumors, the cult maintains hidden enclaves throughout coastal Khorvaire, including Tlalusk Island off the Demon Wastes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"MqIPQ5l9Q4HbWSZd"}

Most of Eberron sees only the beautiful facade: artists and entertainers, poets and escorts. Only a select few deal with the sixth demesne of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]: the spies and assassins of the Serpentine Table. Phiarlan entertainers can be found across Khorvaire, from the grandest gala to the homeliest inn. Phiarlan spies are just as ubiquitous, but rarely seen.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is a neutral organization. Though its spies frequently engage in illegal activities in the course of their duties, Phiarlan operatives respect the overall structure of society. Like their ancestors, the leaders of the house see themselves as agents of balance, evening the odds between opponents and exposing conflicts that would otherwise fester and grow.</p>\n<p>The elves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] practice hundreds of different styles of song, dance, and other arts, covering both the ancient traditions of Xen'drik and the modern styles of Khorvaire. Long before the house was formed, the early phiarlans divided the arts into five disciplines, with the greatest masters and teachers of each settling in the five major enclaves of the house, known as demesnes.</p>\n<p>The five disciplines and their demesnes are described below:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Demesne of Memory: </strong>This discipline encompasses the written word, including prose, poetry, and even propaganda. History might be dictated by the victors, but the smartest hire Phiarlan word-weavers to write it down. Novelists, playwrights, and poets are all students of memory. This Demesne contains one of the finest libraries in Khorvaire, a repository both of general knowledge and songs and stories. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven and run by Viceroy Dulaen Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Aundair.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Motion:</strong> These are the arts of the body, including dance, gymnastics, wrestling, contortion, massage, and more. Gymnasts, dancers, and wrestlers are students of motion. For students of motion, combat is a celebration. Gifted students of motion are often recruited by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, their skills adapted to burglary and battle. The Demesne of Motion is located in Wroat, the capital of Breland. It is administered by Viceroy Surael Shol d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Breland.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Music: </strong>The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, including song and the use of instruments. While most bards learn the basic traditions of music, the members of this Demesne delve deeper in their study of the fundamental principles of music. These teachings reflect a wealth of musical techniques from across Eberron. Instructors here are well versed in Adaran chant, Marcher throat-singing, Thelanian ballads, and battle-chants of Shavarath. The demesne is located in the city of Flamekeep, under the leadership of Viceroy Kels Tialaen d'Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Thrane.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Shape: </strong>The discipline of shape covers the creation of physical objects. Demesne of Shape teaches sculptors, painters, potters, and any form of physical art. Its students also create the resources the house requires for its entertainers, from fine instruments to sets and costumes. The smallest and least populated demesne, it holds a specialization few others have the expertise to teach. The masters of this discipline belonged to the Thuranni lines, and the newborn house claimed the Karrnath enclave that housed the demesne during the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the Thrane city of Thaliost, but its operations are overshadowed by those of House Thuranni. Currently the demesne is led by Viceroy Idal Tialaen d'Phiarlan.</li>\n<li><strong>Demesne of Shadow: </strong>In its broadest sense, this is the art of deception. Deceptive magics are a powerful tool in the field of entertainment, and the Demesne of Shadow helps those who can wield these powers perfect their techniques. This includes the artistic use of illusions, puppetry, and literal shadow plays, but the Demesne of Shadow also encompasses the verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigning emotion, and playing a role. Actors and orators learn their craft at this demesne, and while a storyteller might create his tales at the Demesne of Memory, he learns to bring those tales fully to life at the Demesne of Shadow.\n<p>The first Demesne of Shadow was located in Metrol, but was relocated to Sharn after the Day of Mourning. The current matriarch of the house, Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan, resides at the Demesne of Shadow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Phiarlan hydra has five heads, but a sixth is said to lurk in the shadow of the house crest. The Serpentine Table is the effective sixth demesne of Phiarlan, and the espionage arm of the house. The location of the Serpentine Table is a closely guarded secret, and its placement in the campaign is at the DM's discretion. It might be in a major city&mdash;perhaps even in Sharn, hidden beneath the Demesne of Shadow. It could be concealed within a smaller community, or an entire town that exists only as a front for Phiarlan spies.</p>\n<p>Every Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table, arranging jobs and ensuring that the local heirs of the house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. Active agents of the group are hidden even from this liaison, often scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Agents of the Serpentine Table hold one of four ranks. The least are known as shadows, and often serve simply as observers. Wraiths coordinate groups of shadows, while specters are elite troubleshooters. Ghosts are the legends of the house. Only a handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully guarded. The leader of the Serpentine Table is another mystery left to the purview of the DM. The interests of Phiarlan's spies are represented by the Seneschal Taen Shol d'Phiarlan, but those on the inside know that Taen is just a mouthpiece for the Serpentine Table's true master.</p>\n<p>The Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi lines have the most influence within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but a number of lesser lines are well established in the house hierarchy. Prior to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism], the Thuranni line had considerable power; today, just a few members of this bloodline remain in the house, and they are often treated with suspicion.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>To the average citizen of the Five Nations, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] is as harmless as it is intriguing. When a house member is approached, he is likely to be asked which famous Phiarlan entertainers he knows. Those who know of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}&nbsp;treat members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] with more caution, whether out of respect (and a friendly reaction) or carefully veiled hostility.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]'s strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda], and members of that house are friendly toward scions and agents of Phiarlan. Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] typically treat their cousins with cool indifference, though some are more overtly hostile. The only true enemies of the house are the Bloody Shadows, who are always hostile toward Phiarlan heirs.</p>\n<h2>House Phiarlan's HEADQUARTERS</h2>\n<p>The five artistic demesnes, along with the hidden citadel of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, are the most important centers of house activity. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has outposts across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair], and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]. Where it does not have an enclave, it often maintains a presence at the local Gold Dragon Inn, sharing costs and resources with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} also maintains hidden safe houses in cities across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Since the Shadow Schism, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] has been forced to leave Karrnath and the northeast in the hands of House Thuranni. To make up for this loss of territory, it has been working to explore potential markets in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar], and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun], with somewhat limited success.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Phiarlan IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Khorvaire's greatest entertainers are Phiarlan elves, or members of other races who have studied at one of the five demesnes. A singer in a random tavern is revealed to be an elf with the silver mask embroidered on his doublet. A noble lord arrives at a gala with a beautiful Phiarlan escort on his arm. The musicians entertaining at a dragonmarked house banquet bear the silhouette of the mask of shadows. A Phiarlan dancer might even be found in a grungy inn in Darguun, astonishing the locals with her graceful movements and shadow play.</p>\n<p>The house's devotion to the arts can even serve as a source of adventure. A Phiarlan viceroy might ask an agent to retrieve a priceless tapestry from the ruins of Metrol, or send a young heir to Xen'drik in search of an epic poem lost since the fall of the giants.</p>\n<p>Characters engaged in intrigue will see the other side of the Phiarlan mask. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] never turns on its own scions or agents, but for a group of PCs not connected to the house, the hydra can be a dangerous foe. As deadly as a Phiarlan assassin might be, the greatest weapon of the house is information. PCs who are dealing with a wealthy enemy might have their plans spied or scryed upon by Phiarlan agents, providing advance warning and knowledge of the party's weaknesses.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"OKWokSZyYRjnId4z"}

They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment. Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells.</p>\n<h3>Eberron dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls fl.owing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools-such as the lightning rail and elemental airships-require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>\n<h3>Khyber dragonshards&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding-which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleonsrequires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.</p>\n<h3>Siberys dragonshards</h3>\n<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"PPDKhkodjK0XhvW3"}

They manifested the Mark of Passage nineteen hundred years ago, enhancing their skills with supernatural abilities that swiftly allowed them to dominate the roads of central Khorvaire. The dragonmarks were a celebrated phenomenon by this point, and the extended Orien family established itself as a dragonmarked house in short order.</p>\n<p>In the days before Galifar, few except the couriers and caravans of House Orien could cross the boundaries of nations and the holds of minor warlords in safety. With the help of the Mark of Passage and a knack for diplomacy, it became possible for Orien messengers to send information and packages from one end of Khorvaire to the other, with an excellent probability that the goods would arrive intact and in time. Orien caravans also carried human cargo, and as workers and explorers moved across the continent, the house became one of the primary forces driving the commonality of culture that marks Khorvaire today.</p>\n<p>Even as Orien's mundane transportation services connected the Khorvaire of the common folk, the Mark of Passage provided the house with services so exclusive&mdash;and so expensive&mdash;that few but kings and queens could afford them. In a united Galifar, nobles who might once have fought each other were forced to curry diplomatic favor and entertain their peers at court. However, the vastness of Khorvaire (not to mention the land's many dangers) made mundane travel for a royal retinue impractical at best. As such, the teleport ability of the greater Mark of Passage quickly became Orien's most requested (and most profitable) service. Effortless and instantaneous travel between the courts of Galifar helped establish the foundation of communication and trust among the nobility that allowed the new kingdom to thrive.</p>\n<p>As its routes stabilized and Galifar grew, Orien took on a royal commission that seemed like little more than a dream at the time: to connect Galifar's cities with highspeed transport that would allow travel across the kingdom in a matter of days. In 811 YK, the first lightning rail line was established between Fairhaven and Flamekeep. In 845 YK, King Jarot announced his intention to see the lightning rail connect every corner of Galifar, a task that Orien completed in less than twenty years.</p>\n<p>With lines of conductor stones spanning the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations], Orien controlled three crown-subsidized lightning rail routes, all running through the heart of the nation in Cyre. From its humble origins on the trails and trade roads of Aundair, Orien had grown to the house that held a kingdom together.</p>\n<h2>Dark Path Ahead</h2>\n<p>What Orien had built over a lifetime, the Last War shattered in two terrible events. The first of these was in 899 YK, when the White Arch Bridge across Scions Sound was destroyed, most likely by order of King Kaius I. The bridge, which connected the city of Rekkenmark in Karrnath with Thaliost in Thrane, was an indefensible liability for both nations, but when it fell, Orien's primary east&ndash;west link across Khorvaire fell with it. In the aftermath of the war, many have spoken of the need to rebuild the bridge. However, Orien cannot afford the expense of reconstruction, and Thrane and Karrnath have little reason to want their kingdoms linked across the sound once more.</p>\n<p>The second and more devastating loss happened on the Day of Mourning. Orien's three routes met at Metrol, the crossroads of Khorvaire, which was destroyed in the cataclysm that razed Cyre. Orien still maintains that the Cyre lines are intact, but the house has yet to send a commercial coach into the Mournland. Reports from explorers in that wasted land hint that many conductor stones have been stolen, leaving gaps large enough to derail a coach.</p>\n<p>Since the war's end, Orien has managed to go some distance toward offsetting the loss of its profitable lightning rail runs with its other courier and transport services. At the same time, the viceroys of the house are determined to reclaim their former wealth and status, but they know that doing so will require allies. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]&nbsp;might never again be one, but the house hopes that the leaders of those nations can be convinced of the need to reforge links to each other's lands.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","_id":"PpItT56xLd1vnl1y"}

If travel is important in a campaign, little work needs to be done to bring Orien into it. Whether a journey by caravan or lightning rail is simply a means to get to adventure or an adventure in and of itself, the PCs will become familiar with (if not employed by) @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] before they reach their destination.</p>\n<p>Orien caravans are the cheapest and often most dependable means of travel for adventurers. Even those with the wealth to afford the lightning rail or airship travel soon discover many destinations in Khorvaire that only caravans or coaches can reach.</p>\n<p>Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] follows the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses, significant differences exist at the top levels. On the patriarch's council, each guild has three representatives (two elected by guild members, one appointed by the guildmaster) while the house has another three representatives appointed by the patriarch. Protocol is firmly followed at the higher levels. Decisions are rarely made without a quorum present, and a two-thirds majority vote is required for most resolutions. The patriarch almost never makes a decision alone, but presents issues to his council and casts the deciding vote when necessary. It is no surprise, then, that the other houses look at Orien and wonder who is in charge.</p>\n<p>Among the middle to lower ranks of the house, the full acceptance of children born out of wedlock (and halfbreed children at that) throws a twist into the traditional dragonmarked sense of aristocracy. Birth order and blood ties to the house are the primary determination of social status. Within the guilds, more upward mobility is possible, since family ties are less important.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Orien's part in making travel accessible to the population as a whole, most common folk have an initial attitude of indifferent or friendly to members of the house. Citizens of Passage (where @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] wields considerable power) have an initial reaction of friendly or helpful. Members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis] have an initial reaction of friendly to members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien], thanks to the long-standing relationship between their operations.</p>\n<h2>House Orien'S HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The families that made up @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] were originally spread across Aundair, but their transformation into a dragonmarked house created the need for a home. They chose a small town that they renamed Passage, building their main enclave and headquarters there. This they called \"Journey's Home,\" in reference to the amount of time most house heirs would be away from it.</p>\n<p>Journey's Home takes up roughly one-third of the modern city of Passage. It employs nearly half the city's workforce in one capacity or another, with a considerable number devoted to the construction and maintenance of lightning rail carts and caravan wagons. Research into new magical methods of transport and shipping is centered at Journey's Home, and most spellcasting heirs make their homes there.</p>\n<p>All members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] are expected to spend time at Journey's Home, learning the behindthe-scenes aspects of running the house and guilds as they keep up with the industry Orien has created. Guild hirelings might visit on occasion, but such trips are rare, and usually presage advancement or individual honor.</p>\n<p>In addition to Journey's Home, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] keeps enclaves in Sharn, New Cyre, Varna, Korth, Regalport, Krona Peak, Flamekeep, Taer Valaestas, and Trolanport. The house also has outposts and offices in nearly every town on the trade roads and lightning rail routes of the Five Nations and beyond. Most of these offer the services of one or both guilds. Aside from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Vadalis], Orien is the only dragonmarked house to have a significant presence in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches].</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] maintains a number of lightning rail coaches that act as mobile enclaves for important house members. Used exclusively for house and guild business, these coaches are not held to any timetable, and are given priority on the lightning rail lines over commercial and private coaches alike.</p>\n<h2>House Orien IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Any campaign that requires travel across the Five Nations is a perfect candidate for the inclusion of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]. Unlike other houses with their overarching plots and politics, Orien's focus is simply getting from point A to point B&mdash;preferably with everyone alive, still in possession of what they left home with, and having paid their fares. The challenges involved in maintaining this status quo are sufficient that Orien has little time for intrigue, except when the schemes of others interfere with the house's plans.</p>\n<p>NPCs in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] are pragmatic and resultsoriented. All the lofty intentions in the world amount to nothing if you cannot make the coaches run on time. Orien is a service industry, and its members have mastered the art of keeping a pleasant, calm expression in the midst of chaos. All members of the house are family, regardless of where they come from. Anyone outside the house is a potential customer, and Orien ever forgets that.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","_id":"Q2y3r4sS91i2qLBP"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"QgQGwAiz76gkZ3So"}

A half-orc bounty hunter reaches out with the power of his mark to find his prey. A human artificer touches a creation forge, and the symbol on her hand flares as the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of these people possesses a dragonmark, a symbol etched on the skin in colors more vivid than any tattoo, magical power made flesh.</p>\n<p>A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the Mark of Making guides the hands of the smith, while the Mark of Shadows helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The Mark of Storms can scatter enemies with a blast of wind, while the Mark of Shadows can weave illusions.</p>\n<p>You can't buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines within specific species, as summarized in the Dragonmarks and Their Houses table. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence, though not every heir manifests the mark.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses. Over the course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts to establish powerful monopolies. For example, only House Lyrandar heirs with the Mark of Storms can pilot airships. This control over vital services gives the houses tremendous power.</p>\n<p>In the past, the dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar. But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the power to enforce its wishes on the houses.</p>\n<h2>All About the Houses</h2>\n<p>Every dragonmarked house has traditions and secrets. Here's a few facts that apply to most of the houses:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Enclaves</strong>. Most dragonmarked houses maintain enclaves in major cities. These serve as strongholds and hubs for house businesses. A city may also have any number of businesses tied to the house, but these are simply providing services and don't have any direct connection to house leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>Names and Ranks</strong>. Any heir of the house who develops a dragonmark is allowed to add the d' prefix to the house name: for example, Merrix d'Cannith. Despite the Korth Edicts' proscription against house members holding noble titles, regional leaders within the houses are called barons. Most houses are led by a matriarch or patriarch, though some are led by a council.</li>\n<li><strong>Emblems</strong>. Each dragonmarked house has an emblem, a distinctive symbol that features on their heraldry, official seals, crafted goods, and anything else that warrants the house's stamp of authenticity. Each house's emblem appears along with the related dragonmark on the following pages.</li>\n<li><strong>The Twelve</strong>. The Twelve is an organization that facilitates cooperation among the dragonmarked houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriates</strong>. Excoriates are dragonmarked heirs who have been cut off from their houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundlings</strong>. Foundlings are people who have a dragonmark yet have no tie to a dragonmarked house.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys].</strong> Dragonmarks manifest around adolescence. Each house puts its heirs through a trial called the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Test of Siberys]. The specific trials vary by house, but they place the heir in circumstances where they are likely to manifest the mark, if they have it. About half of the members of a bloodline manifest the mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Korth Edicts</strong>. The Korth Edicts prevent the houses from owning land, holding noble titles, or maintaining military forces (with an exception for Deneith). The edicts were established when the Five Nations were united. Today, many in the houses feel the edicts have become obsolete in the wake of the Last War.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmarks and Their Houses</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Dragonmark</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">House</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Race</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Guild Specialties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Detection</td>\n<td>Medani</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, investigation, risk management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finding</td>\n<td>Tharashk</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orc}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Orc]{orc}</td>\n<td>Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Handling</td>\n<td>Vadalis</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Animal training and breeding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>Jorasco</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]</td>\n<td>Healing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospitality</td>\n<td>Ghallanda</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Halfling]</td>\n<td>Food, lodging, urban information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Making</td>\n<td>Cannith</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Manufacturing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passage</td>\n<td>Orien</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Land transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scribing</td>\n<td>Sivis</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Gnome]</td>\n<td>Communication, translation, verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sentinel</td>\n<td>Deneith</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Human]</td>\n<td>Bodyguards, mercenaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shadow</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.01: House Phiarlin]{Phiarlin}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]</td>\n<td>Entertainment, espionage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Thuranni</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]</td>\n<td>Entertainment, assassination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storm</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.01: House Lyrandar]{Lyrandar}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]</td>\n<td>Air and sea transportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warding</td>\n<td>Kundarak</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dwarf]</td>\n<td>Banking, storage, prisons</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h2>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Agent</strong>. You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Scion</strong>. You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Excoriate</strong>. When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</p>\n<p><strong>Foundling</strong>. Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</p>\n<h2>The Powers of the Mark</h2>\n<p>Each dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the inherent powers of the mark. Your dragonmarked race gives you a set of traits derived from the magic of your mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark also fuels or channels some of your spells. Each dragonmark's description includes a list of dragonmark spells that flow from the magic of the mark. If you play a character with the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your dragonmark spells are added to the spell list for each of your spellcasting classes, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.</p>\n<p>You might also consider your dragonmark the source of any or all of your spells or class features. As a cleric with the Mark of Healing, for example, you could say your mark is the sole source of the healing and supportive spells you cast, or your magic might come from a combination of your mark's power and your faith in the gods. As a warlock, your aberrant dragonmark might actually be your fiendish patron, the source of all your magic. These descriptions add flavor to your character but don't change your character's abilities, beyond the dragonmark spells added to your spell list.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the powers of a mark, and these items give the houses much of their economic power.</p>\n<h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can't be removed&mdash;even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity as a character gains levels and uses it to cast more powerful magic.</p>\n<p>While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality.

But what an elder sees as impetuous, a teenage Lyrandar sailor calls bold. Esravash is adored by the rank-and-file members of the Windwrights Guild in particular.\n<p>Esravash's immediate goal is to expand elemental airship service as much as possible, building docking towers in more cities and paying @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] and the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo] for more elemental airships. To finance these plans, Esravash scrutinizes the house's bottom line, and she doesn't tolerate shipping losses.</p>\n<p>Esravash plans to stop losses to the pirates of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]. Elemental galleons are now fitted with catapults, and House Lyrandar's spies are busy following the rumors of experimental, magic naval weapons said to have been developed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] near the end of the Last War.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Torval Enkiliost.</strong> Torval, dragon marked heir of an obscure branch of the Lyrandar family, leads a shadowy operation known as the Stormwalkers. Throughout the latter half of the Last War, the Stormwalkers smuggled fugitives and spies to Stormhome, where they could attend clandestine meetings and engage in cloak-and-dagger activities on neutral ground. The intelligence that Torval gathered along the way kept @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] one step ahead of its rivals. Even though the war is over, many still pay handsomely for a secret voyage to Stormhome.</li>\n<li><strong>Solia d'Lyrandar. </strong>Solia is in charge of Lyrandar's affairs in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]. Troubleshooting various shipping crises keeps her constantly en route from the elemental airship docking tower at the city's pinnacle to the Cliffside docks at its base. Ever since it became known that Solia was considering new routes to Xen'drik, every elemental airship captain has been vying for her favor.</li>\n<li><strong>Taelyn d'Lyrandar.</strong> He does not possess the Mark of Storm. He cannot call the rain or command the elemental energy that drives an airship, but what he lacks in mystical power, he makes up for in wit, charm, and pure dedication to the cause of his house. As a trusted envoy of Lyrandar, Taelyn could serve as a liaison for the party or as the house delegate on the opposite side of a critical negotiation. Having cut his diplomatic teeth on verbal duels with Zil ambassadors, Taelyn is not easily provoked. Words are his weapons, and he uses Sense Motive to search for his enemies&rsquo; weaknesses.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"TAqIde1ttnf3JkUO"}

In addition to this peaceful work, it maintains a massive intelligence network that stretches across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Khorvaire]. The house sells information and intelligence-gathering services to the most powerful people in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations].</p>\n<h2>JOINING HOUSE PHIARLAN</h2>\n<p>In the past, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] allowed individuals to marry into the house only rarely; it would have been unusual to see two such unions in a single century. However, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]{Shadow Schism} was a great blow to the house, reducing both its population and the diversity of its family line.</p>\n<p>As such, Phiarlan's ranks have become more open to those outside the dragonmarked families, though only elves are ever considered for membership. A candidate must have exceptional artistic skill or remarkable talent in the arts of stealth and subterfuge. Experts are well represented within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but its most gifted scions pursue the paths of rogue, scout (from Complete Adventurer), bard, wizard, or sorcerer. Phiarlan spellcasters typically focus on divination, enchantment, and illusion magic, which can be used both for the secret work of the house and for the entertainment activities that conceal it.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf].</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Must be related to a member of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] by blood or marriage or accepted based on extraordinary ability (at DM's discretion).</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Though player characters will likely be drawn to Phiarlan's espionage arm, the house derives most of its income from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}. Phiarlan entertainers cover a vast spectrum of the performing arts, and a typical Phiarlan enclave has musicians, actors, poets, dancers, and professional escorts available. Such characters are often experts or bards, with the occasional spellcaster versed in illusion magic. Rogues, scouts, and other combat-oriented characters might begin as entertainers, but are often more attracted to the Serpentine Table, the espionage arm of the house.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE PHIARLAN BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>The wealth of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] lies in the knowledge of its spies and the fame of its entertainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Since the services of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are available only to those of great wealth or rank, house membership is usually the only way for adventurers to hire Phiarlan spies. The house's intelligence services are normally not discounted (but see Information, below).</p>\n<p>The fame of Phiarlan's entertainers can benefit player characters in a number of ways. First, if they are performers themselves, they can ask the house to help find a local venue and to promote their performances. Even after the house takes its cut, PCs receive a bonus of from 5% to 20% (1d4&times;5) to the income generated by their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance] checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] members can make use of current information uncovered by members of the Serpentine Table in the course of their work. While in a house enclave, a member can gain a +1 bonus on a single knowledge or lore check per day.</p>\n<p>Though characters typically have to pay for the house's intelligence services, a Phiarlan agent might volunteer information to a fellow heir, warning her of a potential threat or the activities of a mutual enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The house can provide routine access to low-level, invitation-only social events, arranging for characters who are not performers to gain entry as part of an entourage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-phiarlan-seal.webp","_id":"URgzVFd4v4bJrWlF"}

The Thuranni coat of arms also includes the image of a length of chain attached to a spiked bar. Heirs claim it symbolizes both their power and the chains that once bound them to tradition and to the Phiarlan. Those few who dare to imply that the image's similarity to a flail&mdash;the traditional weapon of the Order of the Emerald Claw&mdash;is anything more than coincidence are likely to face mocking derision in public, and in private, much, much worse.</p>\n<p>Where the elves of Phiarlan employ the mask of shadows as a secondary standard, Thuranni has adopted the symbol of a crescent moon, its face wreathed in shadow. Members of the house wear this symbol in the form of a small pendant, often hidden beneath the tunic or shirt.</p>\n<p>Unlike the house from which it split, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] makes no pretense to neutrality. The house sees its actions as having greater purpose than simply supporting the subtle machinations of lords and kings. This ideological separation combines with the house's business philosophy to make heirs of Thuranni more ruthless and aggressive than the Phiarlan.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>Most residents of Khorvaire have a passing knowledge that the elves of the Mark of Shadow now comprise two distinct families, but few have any real knowledge of the Shadow Schism or the philosophical divisions that drove the split. Those familiar with the art world know that the heirs of Thuranni comprise the talented painters, sculptors, and architects that once blessed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], but Thuranni heirs typically receive the same degree of respect and awe as Phiarlan heirs (and are often mistaken for them).</p>\n<p>Those who know of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} are more reserved in their dealings with members of the house, though this apprehension can either improve or worsen starting attitudes, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]'s strongest ally among the dragonmarked houses is House Tharashk. The House of Finding is also young and ambitious, and was quick to side with Thuranni after the Schism. Heirs of Phiarlan react to Thuranni with cold detachment, and prefer to keep any encounters brief. At the same time, both houses share a wariness of the Bloody Shadows (see page 119), who are more hostile to heirs of Thuranni than any other group.</p>\n<h2>House Thuranni's Holdings</h2>\n<p>The power of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] is centered in and around the Lhazaar Principalities. The Shadow Network likes to discourage the idea that its operations are based in any one location, but the powerful families that make up the house claim territories that are more or less their own. The Thuranni family, led by the house patriarch, Elar d'Thuranni (LN male elf rogue 6/dragonmark heir 3), has holdings in the Lhazaar capital of Regalport and in Sharn, and most high-level house business is carried out in these two places. The patriarch has also been developing a massive, heavily fortified family enclave near the northern island of Stonespur for the last two decades.</p>\n<p>The town of Tantamar, on the northern coast of the Lhazaar Principalities, is the center of house activity on the mainland. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] has additional enclaves in Droaam, Karrnath, and Q'barra, and has established outposts and safe houses across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF House Thuranni IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Few Thuranni heirs travel to perform or present their arts, so their casual introduction often requires a context. Characters who attend a gala or other event might see Thuranni sculpture on display, or could be introduced to the Thuranni prodigy who designed the hall itself. One of the ironies of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism] is that Phiarlan operatives often find themselves performing within concert halls and theaters designed by Thuranni artisans.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","_id":"V8m3LC7dfEJtghIE"}

Phiarlan assassins removed insurgent leaders and other internal threats. On more than one occasion, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] helped to enforce the strange laws of inheritance, such as the ones which prevented the eldest child of Breland's king from ever succeeding to Breland's throne.</p>\n<p>There were occasions, even in a unified Galifar, when the rulers of the Five Nations plotted against each other and even against their sovereign, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] was often involved in those schemes. Nascent organizations that would eventually grow into Breland's King's Citadel, Aundair's Royal Eyes, and the like relied heavily on intelligence purchased from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan].</p>\n<p>With the death of King Jarot, the best efforts of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] were no longer able to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and Khorvaire was plunged into a century of warfare. Each of the Five Nations built up its own corps of covert agents and set them to work against the spies of enemy nations, while continuing to rely heavily on Phiarlan intelligence. A house that was more strongly unified to begin with might have been able to remain united even under such circumstances, but @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] had always been fractious. The Mark of Shadow appeared not in one family line but in several, and relations among the Phiarlan lines had been strained in the past.</p>\n<p>Five lines&mdash;the Tialaen, Shol, Elorrenthi, Thuranni, and Paelion&mdash;were the most prominent and influential families in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] before the schism. Each line had its particular strengths within the broad field of the house's activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the Five Nations. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together. This lead to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism].</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/mark-of-shadow.webp","_id":"VCD6Wr2TC6Q4AMJe"}

Instead, Orien encourages its heirs to have numerous children, even accepting those born out of wedlock as full scions of the house. This policy has given Orien the largest and most racially varied population of any dragonmarked house in Khorvaire; its members include a number of half-elves and half-orcs. Though such children never manifest the Mark of Passage, they have a home and a future within the house.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] prefers that its members focus on skills and talents useful for day-to-day labor, or ones that enhance the powers granted by their dragonmarks.

Orien is (or at least was) the center of travel and transport throughout the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations] and across Khorvaire. As such, house heirs can be found posted to nearly every corner of the continent.</p>\n<p>House artificers continually work to improve the lightning rail and the arcane enhancements of their caravans, including the magically cooled carts that allow food to be shipped virtually anywhere. Bards are the public face of the house, working as stationmasters, ticket brokers, and couriers. Warriors and fighters often act as security on Orien coaches and caravans. Magewrights work as technicians on coach routes or the lightning rail, while wizards and artificers research new vehicle designs, invent new magic items, or seek to enhance the natural abilities provided by the Mark of Passage.</p>\n<h2>HOUSE ORIEN BENEFITS</h2>\n<p>As befits its place at the center of Khorvairian transportation, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien]'s investments and holdings provide benefits for its heirs across the continent.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear: </strong>Full members of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]{Coutiers Guild} who do not have their own horse and riding gear have them provided, then pay off the base cost at a rate of 20% per year (or sooner if they wish).

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3JnG7ah.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"793\" height=\"288\" /></p>\n<h1>Why Come to Graywall?</h1>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>A Free Town</strong>: Not only is Droaam not one of&nbsp;the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty&nbsp;of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, desert-ers, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Ruins of Dhakaan</strong>: Droaam holds secrets&nbsp;still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Home, Unsavory Home</strong>: In 4th edition, many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs are all covered in the 4th edition Monster Manual, and doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time&nbsp;in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alter-natively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h1>Life in Graywall</h1>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins.&nbsp;In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became&nbsp;a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is&nbsp;a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new bar-racks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures.&nbsp;In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h2>Common Customs</h2>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash;but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus&nbsp;to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for&nbsp;a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns with-held from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight&nbsp;in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champi-ons and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiv-ing these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 312px; width: 292px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"292\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#999999\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">\n<tbody>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#F2F2F2\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">\n<td style=\"width: 288px;\">\n<h1>Graywall</h1>\n<p>Built atop ancient goblin ruins, this town marks the border between Droaam and Breland. Teams of goblins and ogres work ceaselessly to expand the town and its walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong>: 5,800; roughly 500 additional labor-ers are camped in the Stone Pits. Traders, travelers, and Droaamish troops pass through Graywall on a regular basis. The bulk of the population is goblins, orcs, gnolls, shifters, and ogres, but a vast array of creatures live in the town, including minotaurs, gargoyles, harpies, doppelgangers, lycanthropes, oni, and medusas. Humans, half-orcs, dwarves, and members of the other races are largely concentrated in the Calabas; those who live in Bloodstone are largely bandits or fugitives.</p>\n<p><strong>Government</strong>: The mind flayer Xorchylic is the governor of Graywall, and it holds the power of life and death over its inhabitants. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk has been granted the right to administer justice in the Calabas.</p>\n<p><strong>Defense</strong>: The Flayer Guard is both a peacekeep-ing force and a well-disciplined and well-equipped military unit that is among the best Droaam can field. In addition to the 300 soldiers of the Flayer Guard, the gnolls of the Znir Pact keep 100 troops garrisoned in the town, and Xorchylic can call in the Pact as needed. Although it has the trappings of a border town, Graywall is also a military outpost that stands ready to defend the pass against Brelish aggression . . . or to launch a raid, if it comes to that. As such, all members of the labor force undergo basic militia training and can take up arms if necessary. In comparison to the Flayer Guard, this militia is poorly organized and has limited equipment, but the natural abilities of the creatures still make it a force with which to be reckoned.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Law and Order</h2>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcom-ers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Oth-erwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisi-tives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h2>The Economy</h2>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of cur-rency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adven-ture hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase trea-sures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dun-geon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The change-lings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon&nbsp;a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around&nbsp;an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When perform-ing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty. Harpy songbirds typically possess Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10.</p>\n<h2>Food and Drink</h2>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, sto-ries have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find espe-cially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have&nbsp;a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist&nbsp;</p>\n<p>is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompe-tence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n<h1>The Shape of Graywall</h1>\n<p>Ten thousand years ago, the Dhakaani goblins built a fortress to defend the valley between the Graywall Mountains and the Byeshk Mountains. Droaam was a land of monsters even then, and while the Dhakaani built a number of cities past the Graywall, they wanted to be sure they could hold the gate. During the Xoriat Incursion, the fortress of Korash Khaar stood strong for years of battle. Then the daelkyr took to the field of battle. Dyrrn the Corruptor came to Korash Khaar, and the fortress fell before him. Some say the fortress walls absorbed the guardians, and that this accounts for the blood-red coloring of the remaining stones.&nbsp;Whatever the truth of the matter, Korash Khaar was no more, and the pass was abandoned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the course of millennia, many different groups took shelter in the ruins of Korash Khaar. Savage goblins fought over the bloodstained stones. The goblins were driven out by gnolls, who in turn lost the land to ogres and oni during the Borunan Exodus. The ogres abandoned it, and the tales of this time speak of ruddy gargoyles emerging from the stone and a darkness rising from beneath&nbsp;the town. Following this, the haunted ruins were shunned . . . until the coming of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The tales say that it was Sora Teraza who found Xorchylic, who had been bound beneath Korash Khaar thousands of years earlier. The project was entrusted to the mind flayer, and he was given an army with which to work. A number of the old goblin buildings were restored, while others were stripped for their stone and rebuilt. Quarries were quickly established, and ogres hauled great blocks of stone to feed the appetite of the growing town.</p>\n<h2>Architecture and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Graywall is a town built with the strength of ogres, designed by the shared vision of Xorchylic and the medusa masons of Cazhaak Draal. Most buildings are functional structures of bare granite. But as&nbsp;one walks past the plain stone, it appears to ripple and flow in peripheral vision&mdash;the result of strange textures designed by Xorchylic. This subliminal pat-terning produces a noticeable emotional response in sentient beings. A traveler finds that she feels a slight touch of dread when she steps into an alley, while the open square feels pleasant and peaceful. Locations are identified by simple, iconic images; many of the inhabitants of Graywall cannot read, and only the basic icons work for the more dimwitted residents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Graywall is built atop a network of tunnels, and many buildings have at least one level that lies under-ground. Some of these subterranean passages connect all the way to the region known as Khyras, but these passages are typically warded or blocked off; none-theless, a group of adventurers might find a hidden passage to the Deep Door, or break into a building by coming up from Khyras.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Most of Graywall is designed to accommodate mon-sters of all shapes and sizes. The arch of a doorway is large enough for a troll to step through without squeez-ing. Some buildings have a second door for goblins or kobolds; others place a hatch in the main door, with a leather curtain draped down to keep out the weather. Any sort of public room includes stools and chairs in a variety of sizes, as well as skins along the floor for larger creatures to sit upon. Public buildings are likely to have high ceilings and a few perches set up along the walls&mdash;posts for harpies and gargoyles.</p>\n<h2>Districts</h2>\n<p>Graywall is divided into four districts, along with two areas that are not part of the town but might play a role in adventures. The names include both the Goblin name and the Common translation; the first name is the one most commonly used.</p>\n<h3>Bloodstone (Sorghun)</h3>\n<p><strong>Population</strong>: Bloodstone is the largest district and home to most of the Medium and Large inhabitants of the town&mdash;minotaurs, shifters, ogres, orcs not aligned with House Tharashk, and others. Bloodstone is also home to doppelgangers, tieflings, and a variety of ban-dits, deserters, and criminals from the eastern lands who have found refuge in Graywall.</p>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>: The district takes its name from the crimson coloring of the stone used in many of its buildings&mdash;stones recovered from the shattered walls of Korash Khaar. Bloodstone is the classic image of Graywall, with ogres and goblins rubbing shoulders with brigands and war criminals. It is a dangerous place for any foreigner who steps out of line. A troll doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pick a fight with an adventurer, but it won&rsquo;t turn one down, and the streets are full of monsters ready to join in a brawl.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CFoBRPc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"505\" height=\"310\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Inns</strong>: The Hydra Halls; The Labyrinth.</p>\n<p><strong>Taverns</strong>: The Bloody Tooth; The Broken Sword; The Venomous Voice.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplies</strong>: Tooth and Steel.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragonmarked Services</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Temples</strong>: The Street of Shadows.</p>\n<h4>Key Locations</h4>\n<p>Bloodstone is home to a variety of unsavory establish-ments; the following are merely a few of the more stable businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>The Arena</strong>: The people of Droaam love their blood sports, and battles take place in the arena every night. Combats include formal grudge matches, open melees, bounty battles with fierce beasts or condemned criminals, and trials for the soldiers of the Flayer Guard. One popular form of bounty battle is Six Stones, in which seven challengers are set in the arena with one or more basilisks; the combatants are not allowed to fight the basilisks or kill one another, and the contest continues until only one contestant remains. PCs who wish to fight in the arena can seek a sponsor who can get them into the ring for a share of the purse (level 4 skill challenge, complexity 1, primary skill: Streetwise). The two likely sponsors are Kel&rsquo;Ashta, a Tharashk orc who monitors the arena for possible mercenary recruits; and Fela Fingerbones, a clever goblin rogue whose family has been spreading its roots into gambling activities across Graywall.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Tooth</strong>: The Blood Tooth is a rough tavern; any disputes between patrons can be settled quickly in the challenge ring in the common room. The Bloody Tooth caters primarily to monstrous clientele, and humans and their ilk receive a cold welcome here.</p>\n<p><strong>The Broken Sword</strong>: A tavern catering to ex-soldiers of the eastern nations, the Broken Sword has Knights Arcane to Darguul chainmasters within it at any given moment. Located in Bloodstone, this tavern counts war criminals, brigands, and revolutionaries among its clients. A Cyran warforged named Maul serves as both bartender and bouncer; either he owns the tavern,&nbsp;or the true owner has chosen to remain anonymous. Patrons of the Broken Sword are expected to leave their national feuds outside. Within the Broken Sword, the Thrane paladin and Karrnathi bone knight are both exiles. The unwritten rule is that if anyone starts a fight in the Sword&mdash;especially a Sentinel Marshal or other bounty hunter&mdash;every patron lends a hand, acting to end the fight as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rings</strong>: The arena is the sight of grand battles, but no shortage of conflict exists through-out Graywall. Circles are scratched into the ground at many of the major intersections in Bloodstone. Most contain large chunks of stone, shards of broken statues, or patches of dried blood. A wide variety of challenges take place in these rings. Brawling and feats of strength are commonplace. Minotaurs engage in a form of wrestling in which the two combatants seek to push or shove the opponent out of the ring. Most of these are skill challenges involving Athletics, Endurance, or Acrobatics, but there are alternatives. A kobold duel is a match of insults and put-downs, judged by the onlookers; such a challenge could use Insight, Intimidate, and Bluff to determine success.</p>\n<p><strong>The House of Worms</strong>: An injured gladiator who can&rsquo;t afford the services of House Jorasco can try his luck at the House of Worms in Bloodstone. The griz-zled and ornery longtooth shifter who runs the hostel is known as Worms, due to his use of broodworms in treating infected wounds. Although his techniques are disturbing, Worms has a Heal skill of +15. Usually Worms can provide only mundane treatment, but he&rsquo;s always on the lookout for ritual scrolls, and at any given time he might assist with a ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hydra Halls</strong>: Graywall is a young town that was built to house thousands. The Hydra Halls are mass dormitories, and each is virtually identical in layout and appearance to the others. The only dis-tinctive feature of a hall is the unique icon painted above the main entrance. As such, an ogre knows that he lives in the Eye or the Claw. Most of the halls are assigned to specific work crews, but a few have rooms available for monstrous travelers on a barter basis. The halls are spread around the two enormous grist mills, where the laborers go for food, drink, and harpy song.</p>\n<p><strong>Jabra&rsquo;s</strong>: A distant relative of the Daughters of Sora Kell, the night hag Jabra is an alchemist of remark-able skill. In addition to selling traditional potions, she produces dragon&rsquo;s blood, blood gin, and other unusual and possibly dangerous elixirs. She also bottles dreams and nightmares, and for a sufficient price she could acquire the dreams of a specific individual for the PCs. Jabra&rsquo;s storefront is a simple tent, and she moves around Bloodstone on a daily basis, sometimes disappearing for days or weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>The Labyrinth</strong>: Built at the base of an old quarry, the Labyrinth is a literal hole in the ground. Its rooms are scattered throughout a maze of passages, making it the perfect home away from home for the fugitive who doesn&rsquo;t want to be found. A family of minotaurs owns the bar, and they take the privacy of their guests seriously. The average cost of a room is 2 gp per night, with a 10% discount for long-term rental. The price is high given the austere nature of the accommodations, but the Labyrinth caters to fugitives who have gold and need privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Skin Factory</strong>: Although laborers can eat a meal at a grist factory, no one likes grist. The Skin Factory is the name given to the collection of slaugh-terhouses, butchers, and tanners found on the edge of Bloodstone. The merchants of the Skin Factory are looking for fresh meat, and PCs who bring any kill to the district can get something more useful in trade, whether nuggets of precious metal or preserved rations for the road. The Skin Factory includes Horac&rsquo;s Hides, which is home to a family of orc tanners who make excellent leather and hide armor. Although most of their work is mundane, grandfather Gech learned tricks from an oni and can produce enchanted armor. A PC who earns the favor of the Horacs might be offered a unique piece designed by Gech.</p>\n<p><strong>The Street of Shadows</strong>: Shrines to demons&nbsp;and various faces of the Dark Six are scattered across Graywall, but the Street of Shadows is lined with them. From the cairns of the Znir gnolls to the horned idols of the minotaurs, there are dozens of icons and altars. The street ends at the Eye of the Shadow, a small windowless temple formed from black stone. The medusa priestess Zerasha holds court here. A fearsome combatant and skilled ritual caster, Zerasha is the most influential voice in Graywall after Xorchylic; the people of the town have come to trust her oracular gifts. At the moment, she is an ally of the Daughters of Sora Kell, but her first loyalty is to the Shadow and to her own warlord, the Queen of Stone. Should there ever be a civil war in Graywall, the black-scaled medusa will be a force with which to be reckoned.</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth and Steel</strong>: Members of the Flayer Guard are outfitted by the Karda Forge and the goblins of Little Graywall, but there are always customers for arms and armor in Droaam. Staffed largely by shifters and minotaurs, Tooth and Steel produces highly distinctive (albeit mundane) equipment in all sizes. The master of the forge is the oni mage Szalas Jal, who has focused his mystical studies on the creation of enchanted weaponry. Szalas spends years working on his weapons, and they are tools of great power; he rarely sells these masterpieces, but might make an exception.</p>\n<p><strong>The Venomous Voice</strong>: All the grist mills and most of the taverns of Bloodstone have a harpy songbird in residence, but these are frequently novices honing their skills. The best of these deadly singers reside at the Venomous Voice, a tavern that serves both as a roost for the independent harpies of Graywall and a place for daring patrons to hear musical duels between harpy virtuosos. Entertain-ment at the Voice also includes storytelling, choral training (used to teach the youngest harpies the basic skills), and command performances by the most gifted sirens. Many who visit the Voice find them-selves braving the dangers of Bloodstone to return to the harpy tavern, and some jaded tourists travel from the Five Nations to hear the legendary performances. The Venomous Voice is managed by Zoryanna of the Last Dirge flight, a devotee of the Fury.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Hooks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An ally of the PCs has been condemned to fight in the arena for one week&mdash;and the odds of his surviving that long aren&rsquo;t good. Can the PCs find a way to free him from the arena between matches? Or do they fight in the arena at his side?</li>\n<li>Szalas Jal of Tooth and Steel has crafted a blade inscribed with dragonmarked patterns&mdash;a blade he believes has a role to play in the Prophecy. He thinks that one of the PCs might be destined to wield this weapon. But to prove it, the PC must fulfill a lesser prophecy&mdash;by passing through the Deep Door and defeating the Impure Prince who makes his lair beneath the town.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The PCs acquire a bottled dream that suggests someone is planning something they want stopped (anything from killing one of the PCs to starting a war between Droaam and Breland). Can they find Jabra, and if so, can they convince her to tell them the identity of the person from whom she harvested this dream?</li>\n<li>The PCs learn that an infamous war criminal is holed up in the Labyrinth. There is a high bounty on his head. But when the PCs make a move, they discover that the supposed criminal is a doppelganger. It&rsquo;s a trap laid by the medusa priestess Zerasha, who wishes to slay destined champions of Dol Arrah or the Silver Flame. Can the PCs escape from the Labyrinth, and if so, what else does the priestess of the Shadow have waiting for them?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Calabas (The Kennel)</h3>\n<p><strong>Population</strong>: House Tharashk is the pillar of this district, and humans, orcs, and half-orcs make up&nbsp;a significant segment of the population. Most of the expatriates and travelers from the east reside in the Calabas or at least pass through it, and most of the elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings of Graywall can be found here. Many menial jobs are held by goblins, though few live in the district.</p>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>: Surprisingly civilized, the Calabas&nbsp;is a piece of the Five Nations trapped in Droaam. Buildings reflect the styles of the Five Nations. Bright colors on the buildings and in the glass windows, with painted signs bearing names written in the Common tongue, provide a flamboyant range of shades to the area. Orc guards in Tharashk livery patrol the streets, but the more frightening monsters&mdash;trolls, harpies, medusas&mdash;are rarely seen here.</p>\n<p><strong>Inns</strong>: The Gold Dragon Inn; The House of the Nine; The Twilight Palace.</p>\n<p><strong>Taverns</strong>: The Cracked Keg; The Merry Marcher.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplies</strong>: The Goblin Market; Vorgath&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragonmarked Services</strong>: Ghallanda; Jorasco; Kundarak; Orien; Phiarlan; Sivis; Tharashk.</p>\n<p><strong>Temples</strong>: The House of the Nine (Sovereign Host)</p>\n<h4>Key Locations</h4>\n<p>The Calabas contains locations that might be of interest to PCs. The numbers are keyed to the map associated with this district.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>The Roar</strong>: The heart of the Calabas is a vastplaza. It takes its name from the statue at its center, which is of a rampant dragonne roaring at the sky. The beast is the sigil of House Tharashk and reflects their power in this district. Aside from its scenic value, at night the Roar plays host to the Goblin Market. All manner of monstrous merchants come to sell their wares to travelers and tourists. Smiths and artisans from Bloodstone and Little Graywall bring their mundane goods, but astute shoppers might find stolen goods, relics recovered from Dha-kaani ruins, treasures stripped from fallen soldiers, or any number of other surprises.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>House Tharashk Enclave</strong>: The Tharashk triumvirate believes that Droaam holds tremendous opportunity for their house, and their Graywall enclave is the largest outside Zarash&rsquo;ak. In addition to selling the services of inquisitives, trackers, and guides, the enclave holds training facilities for the monstrous mercenaries the house employs and serves as a hub for prospecting operations within the region. House Tharashk enforces the law within the Calabas, and the enclave includes an audience chamber where Baron Kundran Torrn or one of his ministers can hold court.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>The Twilight Palace</strong>: A joint venture of House Phiarlan and House Ghallanda, the Twilight Palace is a wondrous thing to find in such a savage land. Designed to serve the needs of the wealthy expatriate or the successful merchant, the palace is a grand hostel, with luxurious accommodations and courte-ous staff well-versed in the customs of every nation in Khorvaire. Within its walls, a visitor can easily forget she is in Droaam. Phiarlan minstrels perform works from the golden age of Galifar, and the Ghallanda chefs produce culinary delights to stir even jaded appetites. Thanks to Kundarak security, the Palace is as safe as Xorchylic&rsquo;s fortress. Of course, such luxury comes at a heavy price: room and board starts at 35 sp per night and can go as high as 10 gp per night for a grand suite. If a customer rents an apartment by the week, the cost is reduced by 20%.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>The Gold Dragon Inn</strong>: This inn is virtually identical to the Gold Dragon Inns found in cities across Khorvaire; it is House Ghallanda&rsquo;s ubiquitous accommodations for the budget traveler. The menu serves one simple, comforting dish from each of the Five Nations, so a Karrn trader can relax with a bowl of Nightwood stew and a Thrane can enjoy flame-grilled tribex. The Gold Dragon Inn is managed by Reskal d&rsquo;Jorasco, a former clawfoot wrangler with the scars to back up his stories of capturing dinosaurs barehanded. Room and board at the Gold Dragon Inn costs 5 sp per night, which is reduced by 10% for stays of 5 days or more.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>The Merry Marcher</strong>: Tucked along the edge of the Roar, the Merry Marcher is a friendly tavern for travelers who want something a little more exotic than the Gold Dragon Inn but don&rsquo;t want to brave the dangers of Bloodstone. The Marcher is owned by a half-orc named Durad Taash, and specializes in the cuisine of the Shadow Marches. Half-orcs and orcs from other lands are especially welcome and encour-aged to tell tales of their travels.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Vorgath&rsquo;s</strong>: A former prospector turned entre-preneur, the orc Vorgath provides mundane goods to travelers. Vorgath is willing to buy interesting trinkets from prospectors, and he might buy goods from PCs or have a magic item to sell; he typically has 1,500 gp on hand.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>The Kundarak Vault</strong>: A small building with reinforced walls, the vault is shared by House Kundarak and House Sivis. Neither has an especially strong presence in Graywall, but there is a speaking stone and an access point for the Kundarak vault network, which allows clients of the bank to withdraw goods stored elsewhere in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Far Davandi</strong>: An outpost of the famed Zil haberdasher, Far Davandi can produce clothing designed in the style of any of the Five Nations. It primarily serves expatriates who still remember their homeland fondly.</p>\n<p>9. <strong>House Orien Enclave</strong>: This large outpost is designed to support multiple caravans at once, and it is currently operating below capacity. The Daughters of Sora Kell are interested in establishing trade routes and eventually lightning rails within their realm, and they have subsidized Orien&rsquo;s operations in Droaam. The local Baron, Saria d&rsquo;Orien, is a canny negotiator and has formed close ties within the town.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Hahlo&rsquo;s House</strong>: Although small, this Jorasco house of healing can handle most problems. Thanks to his dragonmark, Hahlo d&rsquo;Jorasco can perform Cure Disease, Raise Dead, or Remove Affliction rituals&mdash;although he adds a 20% &ldquo;Droaam tax&rdquo; to&nbsp;his prices unless he likes the clients.</p>\n<p>11. <strong>The Silenced Stage</strong>: Subsidized by House Phiarlan, this playhouse specializes in works that have been banned in the Five Nations, along with new creations of exiled and expatriate artists. It is one of the major tourist draws in Graywall, since people travel from Fairhaven, Flamekeep, and Korth to see these forbidden performances. The luminaries of the company include Laren Devir, a Brelish playwright known for his antimonarchy rhetoric; half-elf Asta Brand, a Karrnathi singer-songwriter whose opera &ldquo;Army of the Damned&rdquo; is a bitter condemnation of both the Code of Kaius and the Karrnathi use of undead soldiers; and Syro Talandro, a changeling from Thrane renowned for his solo performances and his explorations of the dark side of the Church of the Silver Flame. Asta Brand is the founder of the company, having fled to Droaam after being turned into a vampire by the Order of the Emerald Claw; she considers herself to be a monster, and as such she believes there is no better place for her. If any of the PCs have artistic talent, Asta might seek to employ them in a performance at the Silent Stage; otherwise, Asta or any of the artists might want to talk to PCs who share her birthplace to find inspiration for new works.</p>\n<p>12. <strong>Veils</strong>: Though small, this brothel has a stable of doppelgangers trained to mimic the accents and mannerisms common to any of the Five Nations. In addition to traditional services, Veils also provides escorts trained to pluck an image from the mind of a client&mdash;doppelgangers who can assume the form and mannerisms of a loved one, allowing an expatriate or traveling merchant to enjoy a meal or an evening in the company of someone lost through exile or slain in the war.</p>\n<p>13. <strong>The Cracked Keg</strong>: This seedy tavern hassmoked windows, and it is identified only by the barrel-shaped trade sign hanging over the door. This sign has a single crack running through the unmarked sign. The owner is Banor Blackbarrel, an old dwarf brigand who used to run potent troll grog to the troops stationed along the western border. In addition to serving powerful Droaamish spirits and sponsoring gambling, Banor runs a blood gin den in his basement&mdash;a home away from home for a grow-ing number of dissolute exiles. Banor has contacts throughout the town, and PCs looking to find some-one or something in Bloodstone could find him to be a valuable ally. But he&rsquo;s a ruthless and cruel person, interested solely in his personal profit.</p>\n<p>14. <strong>The House of the Nine</strong>: This small inn and public house is also Droaam&rsquo;s sole temple to the Sovereign Host, run by a human family from western Breland. Hostess Channa Perryn blesses every meal in the name of Olladra and Boldrei, and Cord Perryn performs services in the back room. Neither Cord nor Channa are spellcasters, but they provide spiritual guidance to followers of the Host, and Cord might assist guests with his Heal (+14) skill. Room and board at the House of the Nine costs 5 sp, but&nbsp;there are only four rooms in the inn.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Hooks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A Cyran artificer named Dela Ranner has taken refuge in the Twilight Palace. The PCs have been hired to take her out of Graywall and back to their home country, as quietly as possible. First there&rsquo;s the challenge of overcoming the security of the Palace. But beyond that the PCs find themselves in conflict with spies and assas-sins from across Khorvaire. It seems Dela knows something about the cause of the Mourning. But what does she know&mdash;and do the PCs want even their own nation to have access to her?</li>\n<li>Asta Brand tells the PCs that the Order of the Emerald Claw is building an eldritch machine below the Calabas that might cause an army of undead goblins to rise and slaughter every citizen of the Five Nations in the town; they hope this causes war between Breland and Droaam. Do the PCs trust the vampire, and if so, can they stop the Claw?</li>\n<li>Cord Perryn of the House of the Nine approaches a PC who worships the Sovereign Host. Perryn has had a vision from the Sover-eigns: A great evil is brewing in the Tharashk enclave, and only the PCs can cleanse it. This evil is a cult of the Dragon Below, whose influ-ence has spread throughout the enclave. They have already called up a number of aberrations from the depths; depending on the power of the PCs, they might now be working to summon Dyrrn the Corruptor. Xorchylic hates the lords of Xoriat, and this could be a chance for the PCs to earn the favor of the master of Graywall&mdash;but it might be a dangerous task, and depending how it is handled, it could easily make an enemy of House Tharashk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/biZlpaC.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"505\" height=\"312\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" />Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)</h3>\n<p><strong>Population</strong>: Goblins and kobolds live here, along with a handful of gnomes and halflings scattered throughout the quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>: Sar Kuraath lives up to its name&mdash;it truly is little Graywall. Much of the town is designed to accommodate Large creatures, and the Hydra Halls have high ceilings and rooms with bunks large enough for trolls and ogres. But goblins are the single most numerous race in Graywall, and Little Graywall is built for them. Every building is designed for Small creatures. The goblin artisans produce goods for the Flayer Guard and the rest of the town, and work-houses have high ceilings and doors allowing ogres easy access to the goods they haul between districts. But all other aspects of the district&mdash;from furniture to the flagons served at Black Bahiri&rsquo;s&mdash;are designed with Small creatures in mind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The goblins and kobolds of Graywall are proud of the measure of independence they have gained under the rule of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and Little Graywall is the symbol of this. Although there are tribal rivalries, goblins of different tribes almost always unite to fight a larger foe. As a result, the natives of this district are unusually bold here in their home, and they are less likely to put up with abuse from outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>Inns</strong>: Black Bahiri&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p><strong>Taverns</strong>: None (Black Bahiri&rsquo;s).</p>\n<p><strong>Supplies</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragonmarked Services</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Temples</strong>: No public temple, though most warrens have their own idols or shrines.</p>\n<h4>Key Locations</h4>\n<p><strong>Tribal Warrens</strong>: Each goblin or kobold tribe has its own building, which is a structure that serves both as workhouse and barracks. Symbols painted over the door or embedded in the walls indicate the tribe that lives within: the Bone Crows, Hammer-Knockers, Hidden Hands, Stonebreakers, and others. By and large, each tribe focuses on a specific trade; the Stone-breakers work in the mines and quarries, while the Hammer-Knockers are blacksmiths and armorers.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Bahiri&rsquo;s</strong>: A single grist mill is in the Little Graywall, and most of the inhabitants dine there or make meals within their warrens. However, one inn has gained a measure of renown throughout Gray-wall. Black Bahiri is remarkably fat for a goblin; he is also a talented chef skilled in both Droaamish and Talentan cuisines. Thanks to under-the-table deals he gets prime materials from the Skin Factory in Bloodstone, and his Talentan preparations might be the most palatable food an easterner can find outside the Twilight Palace. Bahiri has rooms for rent, and there are a few gnome and halfling exiles who make their homes here. Some believe that Black Bahiri&rsquo;s is a center for intrigue; there are rumors that the gnome who calls herself Shiv is a top agent of the Trust, and that Bahiri is a master spy from the Shaarat&rsquo;khesh. These things might be true, or they might be pure fantasy. But if one is looking for a good meal accom-panied by goblin song and cheerful company, Black Bahiri&rsquo;s is a fine choice. Bahiri does keep blood gin on hand for foreigners, but he does not sell the drug to goblins. Renting a room at Black Bahiri&rsquo;s costs 1 gp per night; since he has a limited number of rooms, Bahiri might turn down an unpleasant customer.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Death</strong>: Many people come to Droaam in search of goods they cannot legally buy in the Five Nations . . . such as poison. It&rsquo;s possible to find simple toxins in the Goblin Market, but Graywall is home to a true master poisoner, a goblin named Swift. Some say that he is part of the Shaarat&rsquo;khesh, while others claim Swift learned his trade poisoning ogres who abused his tribe. Arranging a meeting with Swift requires a skill challenge (level 7; complexity 1, primary skill Streetwise; a goblin gets a +3 bonus, and anyone asking in Black Bahiri&rsquo;s gets a +1 bonus). It&rsquo;s up to the DM to decide just what Swift has avail-able at any given time, but he&rsquo;s one of the best sources of poison in western Khorvaire.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Hooks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An ally has been poisoned by a toxin that resists all magical treatment . . . a slow-acting venom mechanically similar to a disease. If anyone can create a cure, it&rsquo;s Swift&mdash;but the PCs first have to learn about the goblin&rsquo;s existence, locate him, and then convince him to help them.</li>\n<li>A Stonebreaker goblin named Jorl approaches the PCs. He says that his clan found a great treasure in the depths, and that they can give it to the PCs&mdash;if the PCs murder a visiting oni mage and his ogre followers, who once held the Stonebreakers in bondage.</li>\n<li>The gang wars in Sharn have escalated, due largely to the treachery of Zharo, a halfling from the Boromar crime family. Zharo has stolen a lot of the Boromar&rsquo;s treasury and hidden it; unless they can recover their treasure, the balance of power in the City of Towers will be irrevocably altered. Zharo is hidden in Black Bahiri&rsquo;s, drink-ing blood gin and hiding from the world. Can the PCs find him, and can they convince him to reveal the location of the treasure?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Karda (The Throne)</h3>\n<p><strong>Population</strong>: The Karda is the home of the Flayer Guard and the Znir Pact barracks. Orcs, ogres, mino-taurs, and gnolls make up the bulk of the population, while the troop of war trolls form an impressive (if small) segment of it. Aside from the soldiers, goblins and orcs can be seen performing menial tasks and civilian jobs. Foreigners are not welcome here, and few humans or other easterners are visible.</p>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>: For all that it can be seen as a center for trade, Graywall is a military outpost on the border of Droaam and Breland, and the Karda is the fortress at the heart of the town. High, thick walls surround the district. Foot soldiers patrol the streets, and harpies and gargoyles circle overhead. The gates are open, but the minotaur sentries question any who wish to enter, demanding to know the business that takes them to the Karda. Foreigners are treated with suspicion and might be questioned by patrols.</p>\n<p><strong>Inns</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Taverns</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplies</strong>: None.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragonmarked Services</strong>: Ghallanda; Jorasco; Kundarak; Orien; Phiarlan; Sivis; Tharashk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Temples</strong>: No public temples, though there are shrines in the barracks.</p>\n<h4>Key Locations</h4>\n<p>No businesses are in the Karda. There is a grist&nbsp;mill for the soldiers, but no public amenities. It is a fortress, with barracks for the Flayer Guard and Znir Pact, armories, and other facilities needed to hold the citadel in the face of a siege.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Keep</strong>: The seat of Xorchylic&rsquo;s power, the Keep is the strangest building in Graywall. The mind flayer took a personal hand in its design, and its walls are whorled and rounded; at times they gleam with an iridescent sheen. Fifty elite troops are garrisoned within the tower, and it is fortified to withstand a siege. Xorchylic&rsquo;s throne sits on the third floor, and he spends most of his time in this great seat, listening to the thoughts of the town and plotting an incompre-hensible revenge against the lords of Xoriat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Last Tower</strong>: This is the courthouse of Gray-wall. It is also the last place many of those who come before a magistrate ever see. The tower serves both as a prison and as a center for torture. Droaamish law doesn&rsquo;t believe in incarceration as a form of rehabilitation, and prisoners are only held if they are waiting for transfer, execution, or serving a sentence in the arena (which can last days or weeks). Public executions are held in the plaza, and statues are also arranged around the tower&mdash;these are victims petri-fied by the medusa magistrate and left as a warning to others. Typically, the justice has the right hand of a petrified victim removed, to ensure that if the victim is restored it is at least maimed.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Hooks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;The PCs are hired to rescue a petrified victim (possibly a friend, or a spy from their nation who has learned vital information) from the courtyard of the Karda. They have to identify the target among the stone menagerie and then either remove the statue from the Karda or perform the Remove Affliction ritual in the Karda&mdash;all beneath the watchful eye of Xorchylic and his Flayer Guard!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Deep Door (Khyras)</h3>\n<p>Graywall is built atop the ruins of Korash Khaar, and the fortress of the Dhakaani goblins stretched deep beneath the earth. The fragments of history suggest that the final attack that broke the Dhakaani defenses came from beneath the citadel. No one living knows just what lies below the Dhakaani tunnels. Almost all the entrances to the depths have been sealed, save for a heavily guarded passage in Bloodstone . . . the Deep Door. Xorchylic has allowed adventurers to enter the depths before, for reasons of his own; it&rsquo;s also possible that PCs might learn of an unguarded pas-sage to the deep tunnels. What lies beyond the Deep Door remains a mystery. Storytellers spin tales of aberrant legions locked in combat with goblin ghosts and of deep wyrms atop piles of Dhakaani gold. The truth might be more wondrous still, or infinitely more terrible.</p>\n<h3>The Stone Pits</h3>\n<p>Graywall is a town in progress. To the east, the&nbsp;scars of quarries run deep into the stony ground, while the west holds the rough foundations of new buildings&mdash;additional hydra halls and new fortifica-tions. Although most of the members of the labor force have bunks within the town, some are awaiting the construction of these barracks. In addition, new monsters are coming to Graywall every week in search of opportunities. Droaam is still a nation in progress. Many of its people still chafe under the rule of their tyrannical warlords, and they hope to achieve greater things by serving the Daughters directly&mdash;or at least by serving the Lord of Graywall. As such, the Stone Pits are surrounded by a tent town made up of both temporary workers and those refugees who hope to join their ranks.</p>\n<h1>Forces within Graywall</h1>\n<p>Many factions are at work in Graywall. Although the Daughters forged Droaam into a nation, tribal and racial ties are still a powerful force within the town. Ambitious warlords such as Tzaryan Rrac or the Queen of Stone might have their own operatives in the town. And then there are the spies, Brelish bandits, and groups of deserters or war criminals drawn from across Khorvaire. Here are descriptions of a few organizations, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<h2>The Flayer Guard</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Korgel Blackblade (male war troll&nbsp;battle champion)</p>\n<p><strong>Other Notables</strong>: Jalira Stormtongue (evil female blood-fire harpy warlord 11), Salan (evil male wererat rogue) The Flayer Guard, elite soldiers of Droaam, keep the peace in Droaam, but they stand ever ready to face&nbsp;a challenge from Breland&mdash;or to launch an attack against the eastern kingdoms. The majority of the guards are orcs and minotaurs, along with a few ogres and trolls (remarkably intelligent for their kind, but still saved for brute force operations). The Flayer Guard has a number of special units. Jalira Storm-tongue commands a squad of gargoyles and harpy archers who serve as scouts and air support; while she is otherwise identical to an 11th-level bloodfire harpy, Jalira&rsquo;s burning song deals lightning and thun-der damage. Salan commands a squad of ten small wererats; all possess a +3 bonus to Stealth and Percep-tion, and they appear as goblins when not in hybrid form. The true core of the Flayer Guard is the team of twenty war trolls, a unit trained by Sora Maenya. These fearsome soldiers are under the command of Korgel Blackblade, a war troll of terrifying skill and power, who wields a magic greatsword forged by Szalas Jal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Each member of the Flayer Guard is utterly devoted to the group&rsquo;s illithid master, due equally to patriotism and psychic conditioning. They are veteran soldiers and use intelligent tactics in combat; players expecting orcs and ogres to be bumbling buffoons are in for an unpleasant surprise.</p>\n<h2>House Tharashk</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Baron Kundran Torrn (male half-orc) Other Notables: Kel&rsquo;Ashta (evil male orc), Mor&rsquo;Ashta (evil male orc bloodrager), Jana Velderan (female human ranger 8), Lagraa (female half-orc)</p>\n<p>House Tharashk is a powerful force within Graywall, especially within the Calabas. Under Baron Kundran Torrn, the house has reached out to orcs across the town. Through his generosity and feats in the chal-lenge rings, Kundran has also earned the respect&nbsp;of many of the other inhabitants of Graywall. The Graywall enclave is the hub of a number of different operations, including prospecting within the region, employing and training monsters to serve as mercenaries and laborers in the east, and the usual work of finding anything that needs to be found. Kel&rsquo;Ashta is a talent scout for mercenaries, who is well connected with the Graywall arena. Mor&rsquo;Ashta commands the house guard that minds the enclave and maintains order in the Calabas&mdash;a mixed force of 20 orc raiders, berserkers, and warriors, along with any monstrous mercenaries currently on hand. And Jana Velderan is the chief inquisitive. Jana has faced challenges in Gray-wall due to her race, but she&rsquo;s good at what she does and has made contacts with many of the local bandits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lagraa is the spiritual counselor of the enclave, and her nature determines what sort of long-range stories might evolve here. She might be an adept of the Gatekeeper druids, in which case she can call on PC Tharashk heirs to fight aberrations and terrors beneath the town. However, she could be an evil priestess of the Dragon Below, slowing spreading her poisonous beliefs throughout the enclave and calling up horrors from the darkness. If this is the case, the Tharashk enclave could ultimately become the hub for an epic adventure, since Lagraa and her disciples release a daelkyr lord! Will this madness taint all House Tharashk, or has it been contained in Graywall?</p>\n<h2>The Redcaps</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Gurb Bonecrow, also known as the Raven&nbsp;(male goblin hexer wizard 5)</p>\n<p><strong>Other Notables</strong>: Reka the Razor (evil female kobold slyblade rogue 5)</p>\n<p>Inspired by stories of the fey of the same name,&nbsp;this gang is made up of goblins and kobolds, and&nbsp;it operates out of Little Graywall. For thousands of years, the smaller races have been oppressed by larger, more powerful creatures. The Redcaps are dedicated to taking vengeance for these indignities. They enjoy ambushing ogres and trolls on general principle, but specifically target anyone who abuses goblins or kobolds, whether they are locals or foreign-ers. So far they have not provoked a response from the Flayer Guard, but this could be a matter of time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Redcaps are drawn from multiple tribes. They operate in secret, hiding behind masks and their blood-soaked red caps. The group is led by Gurb Bonecrow, a talented goblin wizard who calls him-self &ldquo;the Raven&rdquo; when masked; his chief lieutenant is Reka the Razor, an especially deadly slyblade.</p>\n<h2>The Old Bones</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Zaris Lornath (evil male human warlord)</p>\n<p><strong>Other Notables</strong>: Cayna (evil female dwarf death master), Desh Anarn (evil male skeleton tomb guardian bodyguard)</p>\n<p>The Old Bones are veteran Karrnathi soldiers&mdash;patriots and fanatical followers of the Blood of Vol. However, they are not members of the Order of the Emerald Claw; they have concluded that the leaders of the Emerald Claw are not truly devoted to the principles of the Blood of Vol, nor do they have the best interests of Karrnath at heart. They dream of some day driving the treacherous Kaius III from&nbsp;the throne and simultaneously cleansing the ranks of the Seekers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Although their goals might appeal to Karrns, the Old Bones are not virtuous champions. Many of them are war criminals who are wanted for acts of extraor-dinary cruelty during the Last War. The cleric Cayna is infamous for slaughtering prisoners of war so that he could raise them as undead soldiers, and Zaris Lornath ordered many attacks on civilian popula-tions. The Old Bones believe in terror as a tool and necromancy as a weapon, and they stop at nothing to ensure Karrnathi supremacy. The Old Bones could be allies against the Emerald Claw, but they are disturb-ing allies at best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s up to the DM to decide just how powerful Zaris and Cayna are. Their greatest ally is Desh Anarn, a fallen champion of the Blood of Vol returned as a sentient tomb guardian. The circumstances that allowed Anarn to return with such power remain&nbsp;a mystery; this could be due to his great faith in the Blood of Vol, or he could be a creation of Erandis Vol&mdash;a spy sent to watch this splinter group to see if it can be used.</p>\n<h2>The Skinners</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Zurin Souldrinker (male oni night haunter)</p>\n<p><strong>Other Notables</strong>: Gray Garrak (male bugbear stran-gler rogue 8)</p>\n<p>The Mockery is the Sovereign of murder and treach-ery, and the Skinners believe that he guides their hands. This gang of monsters actively preys on the people of the east, killing foreigners foolish enough to leave the safety of the Calabas&mdash;and occasionally venturing within its walls to target an outspoken follower of the Silver Flame or paladin of Dol Arrah. When possible, the Skinners take victims alive so they can be tortured slowly. The leader of this gang is Zurin Souldrinker; his devour soul power strips the skin from a victim even as it inflicts damage, and it can be used on a target that is either unconscious or helpless. His strong second is Gray Garrak, a vicious bugbear with a remarkable gift for slaughter.</p>\n<h2><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AR4YKA6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"299\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" />The Swords of Liberty</h2>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: Tars Faldren (male human demagogue)</p>\n<p><strong>Other Notables</strong>: Tolri (evil female tiefling wizard/devastator), Norn (male dwarf bodyguard)</p>\n<p>The Swords of Liberty operate in secret within the borders of Breland. Tars Faldren is one of the found-ing members of the organization, and when it became too dangerous for him to remain in Breland, he decided to establish a safe house in Graywall&mdash;a haven for Swords on the run and a base of operations from which to openly spread their message. Faldren has been operating out of Graywall since 997 YK, and he has been petitioning foreign governments, speaking with dragonmarked houses and the Korranberg Chronicle, and otherwise spreading his antimonarchy message. Publicly he downplays the violent actions of the Swords of Liberty, but behind the scenes he uses his position to acquire illegal goods for use by his allies in Breland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Faldren&rsquo;s safe house is hidden within Bloodstone. He is accompanied by a number of Swords, including new recruits, bodyguards, and a few others who have been exposed and are wanted in Breland. Chief among these is Tolri, a tiefling wizard infamous for her skill at crafting ritual scrolls that set off terrible explosions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;PCs who sympathize with the Swords of Liberty can come to Graywall to make contact with Tars, or to receive missions or equipment. Alternatively, the King&rsquo;s Citadel could ask the party to infiltrate the Swords and shut them down&mdash;but only after learning about upcom-ing plans and Faldren&rsquo;s contacts within Breland.&nbsp;</p>","_id":"YK60AQTATFTRJqZr"}

The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice. As it stands, Droaam has been split into lheshat&mdash;a Goblin term meaning \"domain of a warlord.\" Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.</p>\n<p>For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city&mdash; though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent.</p>\n<p>Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse&mdash;foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.</p>\n<p>In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>The agents of <strong>Katra's Voice</strong> are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.</li>\n<li>A few elite soldiers of <strong>Maenya's Fist</strong> usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.</li>\n<li>The agents of <strong>Teraza's Eye</strong> are sages, versed in the region's history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg&mdash;that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, \"I am Teraza's Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"bluUtRScyQpfkbmC"}

And in a time of fragile peace, business is booming. During the Last War, House Deneith managed to maintain its neutrality while supplying soldiers to all of the Five Nations. Today, members of the house guard monarchs across Khorvaire, hunt down criminals who flee across the Five Nations&rsquo; porous borders, and even guard the empty throne in Thronehold. Few outside House Deneith have any expectation that the monarchy of Galifar will ever be restored, but the Throne Wardens of the house seem to believe that the day will come when the Five Nations are united under a new dynasty.</p>\n<p>From its beginnings as an order of mercenaries and soldiers to its modern incarnation as the human face of law and battle, House Deneith has maintained its position as the primary force for security and defense in the Five Nations. Though its fortunes rose during the Last War, the services Deneith renders are no less valuable in times of peace. Today, the house is as prosperous as ever, with its position of neutrality firmly established and a host of eager clients ready to use its services. This prosperity tells only half the story, however, and Deneith&rsquo;s past fortunes might not be enough to guarantee the house&rsquo;s future.</p>\n<h2>House Deneith Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Deneith]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Deneith]</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-tharashk-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Deneith Coat of Arms\" width=\"276\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>The first humans to exhibit dragon marks were members of a militant noble family with ancestral lands in what is now Karrnath. With the dragon mark bolstering their military prowess, the Deneith family conquered most of the region; only famine prevented them from carving out their own kingdom in what is now western Karrnath. The Deneith homeland was also the home of Karrn the Conqueror. Although he was not a member of the family, House Deneith pledged fealty to Karrn during his rise to power. When Galifar I united the Five Nations, he charged the house with the protection of his vast new realm.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> Most members of House Deneith are culturally Karrnathi, but the house refused to choose sides in the Last War. Instead, House Deneith offered mercenaries from its Blademarks Guild to all of the Five Nations. Deneith crafted its contracts to ensure that Deneith fighters would never cross swords with other Deneith. (One Cyran general was infuriated when the blademarks under his command wouldn&rsquo;t attack a Deneith-guarded garrison. The Cyrans attacked the blademarks who refused to fight, but were routed by the combined forces of the blademarks and the Deneith garrison guards.)</p>\n<p>House Deneith generally remains at arm&rsquo;s length from political maneuvering among the other dragonmarked houses. But since the Last War, it has started to make cautious moves against House Cannith and House Tharashk. The reason is simple: In the latter days of the war, both made significant inroads against Deneith&rsquo;s dominance in the soldiers-for-hire market. Every warforged soldier built by House Cannith and every (sometimes monstrous) mercenary offered by House Tharashk is direct competition.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Baron Breven d'Deneith}: </strong>A strong idealistic commander, seeing the need for balance and practicality.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Deneith]{Sigor d'Deneith}:</strong> Survived the Day of Mourning by luck, Sigor is now obsessed with finding out what caused the Mourning.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p>Sentinel Tower: Older than Karrnath itself, the ancient keep known as Sentinel Tower is the main enclave of House Deneith, the headquarters of the Sentinel Marshals, and a fortress charged with repulsing periodic monster attacks from the Mournland, just across the river. Its history is rich; Karrn the Conqueror commissioned the first of his generals atop Sentinel Tower. The keep is a confusing maze of fortifications, since its defenses have been renovated and augmented numerous times.</p>\n<p>Graywall Outpost: Early in the Last War, House Deneith accepted a contract from Breland to guard a key mountain pass in the Graywall Mountains between central Breland and what is now Droaam. In 987 YK, when King Boranel&rsquo;s armies retreated from the Graywalls, House Deneith remained in a stubborn effort to hold up its end of the contract. For the next nine years, the soldiers of the house were often near starvation, frequently under siege, and always surrounded, but they held the mountain pass. Even the war&rsquo;s end couldn&rsquo;t dislodge House Deneith, and it has built a small but nearly impregnable keep. Although Droaam (for military reasons) and Breland (for political reasons) would like to see the outpost abandoned, House Deneith shows no sign of leaving.</p>\n<p>Rhukaan Draal Enclave: Many of House Deneith&rsquo;s goblin mercenaries rebelled in 969 YK (an event that led to the founding of Darguun). House Deneith has carefully reestablished relations with the Lhesh Haruuc (leader of the insurrection and now of Darguun). This relationship is one of convenience: Darguun gets diplomatic legitimacy through the association, and House Deneith gets a steady stream of goblin mercenaries. But some within the house are still bitter about Haruuc&rsquo;s insurrection; the enclave in Darguun is a tense place to do business.</p>\n<p>The Rhukaan Draal enclave has two parts: a diplomatic enclave within Rhukaan Draal called Fort Cail (after Lord Cail d&rsquo;Deneith, who first recruited goblins to fight under the Deneith banner more than a century ago), and a fortress known as the Gathering Stone just outside the city, where many blade marks receive their initial training in large-unit tactics.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/house-tharashk-prospectors.webp\" alt=\"House Tharashk prospector's\" width=\"439\" height=\"1000\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-deneith-seal.webp","_id":"emtwljw3Kj7bKswQ"}

Though there were only ten dragonmarked houses at the time, the architect and artificer Alder d&rsquo;Cannith convinced the committee to name the institute the Twelve, based on his belief that there were twelve true dragonmarks in addition to the shattered Mark of Death. Alder was a brilliant man whose works had played a critical role in the War of the Mark, and the members of the committee humored him&mdash;though few expected the remaining two marks to appear. (The remaining two marks, Warding and Finding, were not &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; until after the creation of the Kingdom of Galifar.)</p>\n<p>In the beginning, the Twelve played a critical role in shaping the dragonmarked houses, but as the houses have grown in power and spread across the land, its influence has diminished. Nonetheless, the institute remains one of the premier centers for magical research in Khorvaire. By combining the skills and mystical talents of the different marks, the wizards and artificers of the Twelve have created remarkable items. It took the combined skills of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith], and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak] to create the safe-deposit vaults that allow Kundarak customers to deposit goods at one bank and withdraw them across the continent. Airships, the lightning rail, even the warforged&mdash;these marvels could not have been accomplished without the spirit of cooperation and discovery found among the Twelve.</p>\n<p>Should you rise high in the favor of a dragonmarked house, you might be able to call on the resources of the Twelve. This institute possesses impressive mystical workshops, vast arcane libraries, and the talents of some of the most gifted artificers and wizards in Khorvaire&mdash;all of which could prove quite useful to an adventurer.</p>\n<p>In theory, the Twelve is a neutral foundation: a resource serving all houses equally. However, some speak of a secret cabal at the heart of the Twelve that seeks a return to the days when the institute shaped the future of Khorvaire. Such a group might hope to overturn the Korth Edicts and see the dragonmarked houses rival Khorvaire&rsquo;s nations in strength. Only the DM can decide if this secret society exists&mdash;and how much power it wields.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"fpHZJn03pWuNA3GX"}

Yet the kraken lurks beneath even the fairest seas, and it is hard to see how far its tentacles reach. House heirs and half-elf adventurers might find</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] to be a valuable patron, but those who cross it find that the kraken is a deadly foe. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] uses the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses. The house leader holds the title of matriarch or patriarch, but is often addressed as \"firstborn\" by members of the house who believe that Lyran and Selavash speak through her. The current matriarch is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Lyrandar]{Esravash d'Lyrandar}, one of the youngest matriarchs in the house's history.</p>\n<p>In addition to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Raincallers Guild} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Windwrights Guild}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] controls a number of smaller agencies and cabals. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Sela's Path} is the priesthood of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Lyran's Gift} is the arcane research arm of the house working with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Twelve]{the Twelve}, and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Lyrandar]{Storm Front} is rumored to be a cult operating within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of Arawai and Kol Korran but the mark of the Devourer.</p>\n<h2>NPC Reactions</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] has long championed the Khoravar race, and Lyrandar heirs receive a friendly reaction in many halfelf communities. At the same time, those half-elves who prefer to maintain strong ties to humans and elves (an attitude common in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]) see arrogance in the Lyrandar, and can be unfriendly or even hostile to their cousins. Lyrandar heirs face an unfriendly reaction from the people of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities], but a friendly welcome in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar].</p>\n<p>Lyrandar does its best to spread its dealings across the dragonmarked houses, hiring protection from both Deneith and Tharashk, while using both Phiarlan and Thuranni for intelligence and covert services. Its relationship with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani] is sometimes strained, but tensions with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] run high. Orien suffered during the Last War, and the airship poses a serious threat to their monopoly on overland transportation. Orien heirs are typically unfriendly toward Lyrandar heirs, but real conflict seldom arises between them.</p>\n<h2>House Lyrandar'S HOLDINGS</h2>\n<p>The matriarch of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] has her seat in Stormhome, an island off the northern coast of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]. Lyrandar mages transformed this once-desolate island into a paradise, and it is now home to a number of Ghallanda resorts in addition to the Lyrandar enclave. An Aundairian garrison stationed on Stormhome protects the entrance to Scion's Sound, but the island is informally considered House Lyrandar's territory. It has long been a hotbed of intrigue. Beyond Stormhome, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] has enclaves in most major port cities of Khorvaire, in addition to land in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar] that it holds in violation of the Korth Edicts. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar] elves have little interest in fallen Galifar's laws, and this suits Lyrandar well.</p>\n<h2>MEMBERS OF @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Airships are often an adventurer's definitive mode of transportation, and a colorful contact in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] can add flavor to any campaign. The house can be a generous patron to half-elf adventurers, and it might be interested in adopting a half-elf (dragonmarked or otherwise) with the right skills. Adventurers could be called upon by the house to test prototype airships, accompany missions of exploration, or take part in clandestine efforts to transform Valenar politically, creating a Khoravar nation under the very eyes of the warrior elves.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Lyrandar's ruthless nature and ambition make the house a compelling foe. Dark rumors tell how the house engages in extortion, weather manipulation, blackmail, piracy, and murder to accomplish its goals. Even if the matriarch does not support such strongarm tactics, the sinister Storm Front cult has supporters throughout the house, and it might do so without her knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"hF7EJlOPiPve1D8T"}

Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] has no interest in opening up to those outside the house. As a result, though it offers artistic training through the True Shapers, such training has no connection to the artistic or espionage activities of the Shadow Network.</p>\n<h2>THE SHADOW NETWORK</h2>\n<p>Thuranni's answer to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild} is the Shadow Network, a single organization that encompasses both the house's public and private services. Unlike @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], which operates the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} as a separate branch of the house, Thuranni's Shadow Network is an integrated guild. As such, virtually all Thuranni's artists are involved to some degree in espionage activities, even if only by being aware that their business helps obscure them.</p>\n<p>Agents of the Shadow Network must be loyal to a fault, for they are entrusted with secrets and tasks of critical importance to both the house and its clients. In particular, the Shadow Network accepts assassination work more readily than the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, and this secret is one that network members protect with their lives. Low-level agents of the Shadow Network are typically better informed as to the details of their assignments than their counterparts in the Serpentine Table.</p>\n<p>Where the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} is but one aspect of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], its mirror sect among the Thuranni is the true face of the house&mdash;and all other sects merely veils of convenience. The talent and vision of Thuranni artists is real, but so too is the dedication with which they pursue other, darker arts.</p>\n<p>Like Phiarlan's espionage network, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} divides its agents into four ranks. Unlike in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table}, shadow is the highest rank a member can hope to attain. Those of lowest rank are known as <em>wisps</em>, and they represent a small majority of its membership. <em>Apparitions </em>coordinate groups of <em>wisps</em>, while <em>phantasms </em>are elite operatives and field agents. Each operative is further defined by one of two descriptors. The <em>bright </em>classification signifies an agent who excels at missions of an aggressive nature, including assassination; the <em>pale </em>classification denotes an agent who specializes in deep cover missions of finesse. Though rumors of a fifth rank, an office known as the <em>Master of Shadows</em>, have circulated through Thuranni in recent years, little evidence supports such tales.</p>\n<h2>True Shapers</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] observes the traditional hierarchy of the dragonmarked, but also maintains divisions based on the roles heirs play within the house. Though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] still maintains its own center for the Demesne of Shape in Thaliost, all serious students of architecture, costuming, painting, pottery, and sculpture study at the true heart of the discipline&mdash;the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] enclave in the Karrnathi city of Atur. Thuranni calls its demesne the True Shapers as an unsubtle jibe toward Phiarlan, and students from all races and nations study under its master artists and artisans. The True Shapers is run by Lord Eriz d'Thuranni.</p>\n<h2>Dragon's Path</h2>\n<p>At the core of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni], the Dragon's Path remains dedicated to unraveling the draconic Prophecy as it unfolds on Eberron. Composed primarily of older house members with a strong sense of history and a working knowledge of magic, the Dragon's Path includes architects, astrologers, historians, and the field agents who do their bidding. The traditions of the Dragon's Path are unique, and do not overlap with the dragon prophets, the work of the Chamber, or House Sivis's study of the prophecy. Members of the order believe that the dragons have kept their knowledge of the Prophecy to themselves for far too long, and recall the dragon wars of Aerenal as proof that the great wyrms' agenda sees the \"lesser races\" as expendable if need be. The order is administered and convened by Viceroy Ureilya d'Thuranni.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>The Crooked Kin. </strong>The Crooked Kin are a troupe of performers and sideshow freaks who travel throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds], @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenta Plains], and parts of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities] on the coast of Khorvaire. They have been&nbsp; entertaining the good burghers and hamlets for a few decades. The entire show travels in a caravan of nine covered Vistani wagons pulled by nags. The wagons are gaudily painted and depict the show&rsquo;s performers beneath the legend, &ldquo;The Crooked Kin&mdash; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]'s Greatest Traveling Cabinet of Curiosities!&rdquo; Each wagon has a front and back door opening onto cramped living accommodations inside. They have been licensed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] since the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism].</p>\n<p>The Crooked Kin consists of 13 performers, all people with a variety of physical handicaps or deformities, plus a handful of additional sideshow attractions. Though they all have exotic (or in some cases, frightening) appearances, the Kin are just honest performers trying to make a living, and are concerned for the life of one of their friends. The following people make up the Crooked Kin. <strong>Hap Tarvin, the Flea Man:</strong> A short, hunched man with a distorted appearance, Hap performs with his f lea circus, the Magnificent Carnival of Miniature Wonders. <strong>Kaleb Hesse, the Ringmaster:</strong> An albino man with red eyes and long, white hair that hangs below his knees, Kaleb wears a tall red top hat, a long red coat with gold buckles, and striped trousers. He is the de facto leader of the Crooked Kin. <strong>Lidia Gerod, the Bearded Lady:</strong> Standing nearly 7 feet tall and possessed of a fine beard down to her waist, Lidia acts as a sort of &ldquo;mother hen&rdquo; to the other members of the troupe. <strong>The Pinheads:</strong> Aleece, Lettie, and Poppy are sisters, all of whom havemicrocephaly. <strong>Prince Zar, the Human Caterpillar:</strong> This Mwangi man has no arms or legs. Prince Zar was once enslaved in a Chelish sideshow, but earned enough money to buy his freedom. He joined the Crooked Kin, where he is billed as an exiled prince of the &ldquo;Lost Cities of Darkest Garund.&rdquo; <strong>S&rsquo;jeer, the Vudrani Princess:</strong> Born with four arms, S&rsquo;jeer dresses in exotic silks and speaks with a thick accent, but she is actually from Galt and the daughter of a fishmonger. <strong>The Swarm of Clowns: </strong>These three men, Gerik, Josef, and Tam, each have an extra limb (Josef has three legs, the others have three arms). Besides their skill in clowning, they are also accomplished acrobats and jugglers. <strong>Trollblood, the Giant Man:</strong> A shockingly ugly Ulfen man nearly 8 feet tall, Trollblood entertains the crowds with fire-breathing and his feats of strength. <strong>The Wolf Child:</strong> Supposedly raised by wolves in the Nightwood, this 10-year-old boy is covered in hair. He is unfortunately insane, but the three pinhead sisters treat him like a younger brother. In addition, the show also includes a pair of caged goblin dogs, a morlock, and a giant frog.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bloody Shadows.</strong>&nbsp;Although there is a strong rivalry between @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni] and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], there is a strict limit to the feud: no assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni, he'll try to prove his superior skills, but he won't expose the rival spy. It's a game. But there is a third player, and it doesn't follow the rules. The Bloody Shadows are the survivors of the Paelion line, those skilled or lucky enough to escape the extermination attempt. Though few in number, the Bloody Shadows are lethal assassins, careful and patient. The Shadows want to make their cousins suffer; a Bloody Shadow might draw out his vengeance against a Phiarlan PC over months or years, causing as much pain as possible before striking the final blow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","_id":"i4M6Wa83ck6duWeL"}

Tharashk bounty hunters compete with the Sentinel Marshals of Deneith, and the Liondrake&rsquo;s Roar has broken Deneith&rsquo;s monopoly on the mercenary trade. Arrogant and ambitious, House Tharashk also seeks to increase its own influence among the dragon marked houses by taking @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] down a notch, particularly since Cannith&rsquo;s once-prominent position has already been diminished by the catastrophe of the Mourning. To date, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith]{House Cannith&rsquo;s} need for the dragonshards provided by House Tharashk has kept this feud from escalating, but that could change.</p>\n<h2>House Tharashk Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Tharashk]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Tharashk]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Tharashk]</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-tharashk-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Tharashk Coat of Arms\" width=\"276\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>The Mark of Finding manifested about 1,000 years ago among three @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches] clans&mdash;the Torrns, the Velderans, and the Aashtas. The exploits of dragonmarked hunters quickly became legendary. Three hundred years ago, a team of Sivis gnomes came to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches] searching for this dragon mark. Assisted by the gnomes, the clans bearing the Mark of Finding joined to form their own house. They named the house Tharashk&mdash;a Goblin word meaning &ldquo;united.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The newborn house quickly carved out a niche for itself. The heirs of Tharashk have always been survivors, and they quickly adapted to life in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches] have rich deposits of dragonshards, and upon learning the value of these stones the clans of Tharashk used this mineral wealth to craft a foundation for their house. Since then, their power and influence has slowly grown. There are still those in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]&nbsp;who distrust the &ldquo;graybloods,&rdquo; but by and large House Tharashk has flourished.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> Initially, the war had little impact on House Tharashk; its prospecting work occurred in the wilds, far from the battlefields.

No other house directly touches as many lives, whether through the lightning rail that once connected the great cities of the Five Nations, the caravans that traverse rural lands, or the couriers who deliver letters and packages virtually anywhere.</p>\n<p>House Orien's businesses have been pervasive (and profitable) since before the first appearance of the Mark of Passage. However, the Last War took a heavy toll on this house&mdash;one from which it has yet to recover. After decades of effort, House Orien had spanned the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations] with its lightning rail, but the war and the Day of Mourning shattered the house's intercontinental links. Today, the organization is bent on recovery, but fresh competition from House Lyrandar and the instability of Khorvaire's new age are challenges the house has yet to overcome.</p>\n<p>Members of House Orien carry the Mark of Passage, and they dominate the business of overland travel. From caravan trains to couriers, the members of House Orien are the masters of the road. Their trade has little glamor, and the denizens of House Orien are practical, with no patience for arrogance or conceit. But they are proud: They have kept the lines of trade flowing across Khorvaire for nearly 2,000 years. Although only humans carry the Mark of Passage, House Orien is a cosmopolitan house: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf]{Elves}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-elf]{half-elves}, eladrin, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Half-orc]{half-orcs}, and even @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Changeling]{changelings} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shifter]{shifters} have all married into the line over time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Trade Roads:</strong> Centuries before the creation of the lightning rail, House Orien built the major trade roads connecting the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]. Rune-carved stones are buried beneath the surface of these roads. Orien's caravans and the tack of their messengers' mounts are inscribed with arcane sigils. A bearer of the Mark of Passage can perform a ritual to increase the speed of a caravan or a mount that travels these roads.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lightning Rail: </strong>Since its creation in 811 YK, the lightning rail has been the symbol of House Orien. Faster than any caravan, it is a safe and secure method for transporting goods and people across Khorvaire. Only a bearer of the Mark of Passage can control the elemental that powers a coach. Many lightning rail lines were damaged during the Last War, and the house is still rebuilding the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleportation: </strong>Orien's First Step magewrights are the foremost experts on teleportation in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations]. They developed the Linked Portal ritual, and most permanent teleportation circles in Khorvaire are Orien's. However, teleportation is still a fledgling science, and many people are nervous about using it; a ride on a lightning rail or a Lyrandar elemental airship might take longer, but it is seen as safer.</p>\n<h2>House Orien Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Orien]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Prien Persons of Interest]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Orien]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.By Road and Rail]</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-orien-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Orien Coat of Arms\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>The Mark of Passage appeared in the region of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair] about 1,900 years ago. The merchants and teamsters who developed the mark were experienced travelers who soon discovered their common bond. Initially, there was some competition between the marked families, but members soon realized what they could accomplish by working together.</p>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and diplomacy, House Orien secured safe passage for its caravans. As its fortunes grew, the house improved existing roads and developed new ones. In the days before the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Sivis} speaking stone network, House Orien ran a post system that was used across the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Five Nations].</p>\n<p>The lightning rail was developed with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Cannith] and the elemental binders of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]. This technology revolutionized House Orien's business, and soon the Trailblazers were laying conductor stones across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War:</strong> The Last War was difficult for House Orien. Bridges were destroyed. Lightning rail lines were broken. And toward the end of the war, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] took to the air. House Orien's dominance in the field of transportation is no longer assured.

These way stations primarily support the caravans that pass through, but they are also trading posts. The original Orien families were merchants as well as teamsters, after all. Permanent teleportation circles can be found in every major city.</p>\n<p><strong>Journey's Home:</strong> House Orien's base of operations is located in the city of Passage in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]. This massive enclave takes up almost a third of the city. Lightning rail coaches, conductor stones, and many other goods are produced here.

A fight is often an ambush, especially for those in the guilds. As such, once in combat, you seek to get out of it as quickly as possible. Whether this means avoiding it, escaping it, or putting a quick end to it is up to you. When combat is inevitable, your preferred tactic is to take control of the field.

The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Domain believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.</p>\n<p>Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed&mdash;an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.</p>\n<p>The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find your path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species&mdash;from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.</p>\n<p>All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.</p>\n<p>Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.</p>\n<p>There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam&mdash; the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"kyEFWMZ7xf1Dmh6w"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"nNW2lkkDUbMLYKZ4"}

It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Patrons</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation&mdash;even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play&mdash;there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll&mdash;it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?</p>\n<p>As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.</p>\n<h3>Peculiar Needs</h3>\n<p>There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam&mdash;perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.</p>\n<h3>PeeriNg iNto the Past</h3>\n<p>Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.</p>\n<p>The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?</p>\n<h3>Politics</h3>\n<p>Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations&mdash;especially Aundair&mdash;might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel The Queen of Stone covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>Droaam&mdash;and Graywall in particular&mdash;is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's is a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.</p>\n<p>A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"nQxkyLjnX6IT8fMg"}

The Thuranni elves bear the Mark of Shadow, and they have the same skills and powers as their Phiarlan cousins. However, House Thuranni is smaller than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] and has fewer resources. This discrepancy gives Phiarlan an edge when it comes to entertainment and information-gathering. But Thuranni is unmatched in one field: assassination. Like the displacer beast they use as their seal, House Thuranni elves are deadly and all but untouchable.</p>\n<p>Though the Mark of Shadow was the first of the dragonmarks to appear, the elves of Thuranni are the youngest of the dragonmarked houses. Like their cousins in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], the Thuranni lead double lives. Known among the general populace as fine artists and courtiers, they are equally well known among the knowledgeable elite as purveyors of secrets and dark deeds. In a short time (especially by elven reckoning), the Thuranni @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} has grown to rival and even eclipse its parent sect, the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]. In espionage and undercover work, agents of the new house have as good a reputation as their Phiarlan brethren. In assassination, House Thuranni has a distinct and dangerous edge&mdash;one that makes many within the dragonmarked houses uneasy.</p>\n<p>The edicts of Korth demand that the dragonmarked houses maintain strict neutrality with regard to the political concerns of the land. However, the work of espionage is, by its nature, inextricably linked with the affairs of nations and their partisan concerns. For that reason above all others, existing conflicts within House Phiarlan grew out of control, ultimately leading to House Thuranni&rsquo;s break from the rest of the house in 972 YK&mdash;an event now known as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism].</p>\n<h2>House Thuranni Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Thuranni]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni as an Organization]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Playing a Member of House Thuranni]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism]</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-thuranni-coa.webp\" alt=\"House Thuranni Coat of Arms\" width=\"264\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>Even though the agents of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan&rsquo;s} @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} are spies and espionage experts, the leaders of the house have always sought to be a force for order and balance. On more than one occasion they helped a rightful heir of Galifar defeat would-be usurpers, and if Queen Mishann had called on the house for help, the Last War might have come to an abrupt end. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan] did good business during the war: Every nation needed intelligence. However, this work put the house under tremendous pressure. Shadowmarked elves from different families often found themselves working at cross-purposes, and some lost sight of their neutrality and developed attachments to a particular nation.</p>\n<p>This situation came to a head in 972 YK, when Thuranni assassins turned on another family within House Phiarlan&mdash;the Paelion line. The few Paelions who survived this attempt at extermination went into hiding. Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d&rsquo;Phiarlan condemned the action and called for the excoriation of the entire Thuranni family. Elar Thuranni refused to accept this judgment, declaring his family to be a new house. After years of argument, the Twelve agreed, and House Thuranni was born.</p>\n<p>This is the official story of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Schism], but many questions remain. What triggered the massacre of the Paelions? Elar claims to have uncovered a Paelion plot to assassinate kings and dragon marked barons. But there are those who say that both Elar and Elvinor wanted the split, and used the Paelions as scapegoats. If this is true, what could be the reason?</p>\n<p><strong>The Last War: </strong>For most of the Last War, the Thuranni were part of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]. The Thuranni line was concentrated in northwestern Khorvaire and performed much of its work for Karrnath. It worked closely with the Order of the Emerald Claw, and some say that House Thuranni continues to work with the Emerald Claw today.</p>\n<aside class=\"torn-page\">\n<h2>Influential Members</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.People of House Phiarlan]{Baron Elar d&rsquo;Thuranni}: </strong>Head of House Thuranni, he is an engimatic figure, driven and charismatic.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Key Locations</h2>\n<p>The Shadow Network has safe houses hidden across Khorvaire, but the major enclaves of House Thuranni are found in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities].

Dragonmarks normally manifest in response to stress, and each of the houses has developed a battery of trials that are designed to draw out a latent dragonmark. All members of a house bloodline undergo this Test of Siberys during adolescence. Those heirs who don&rsquo;t develop a dragonmark are presumed not to have it, though some do develop fledgling or Siberys marks later in life.</p>\n<p>The Test of Siberys varies for each dragonmark. The basic principles are the same across a particular mark, but different house enclaves and barons are known to put unique twists on the test, thus keeping the young scions from attempting to duplicate dangerous tests on their own. While the Test of Siberys is specifically designed to trigger a mark, it&rsquo;s not the only way to force a manifestation. Any stressful situation might trigger a spontaneous manifestation. An heir of a house could develop their mark before being tested, while a foundling born outside of the house could trigger a latent mark by unknowingly replicating the conditions of a Test of Siberys. Additionally, some records reflect accounts of heirs within the true dragonmarked bloodlines manifesting aberrant dragonmarks, much to the dismay of the House.</p>\n<p>Many of the foremost experts on the Draconic Prophecy, like Professors Caldyn and Ennis, hypothesize that such instances are the design of the larger tapestry of fate, and marks appear in completing the necessary steps toward whatever end the Draconic Prophecy declares.</p>\n<p>In creating a dragonmarked character, think about the events that caused your dragonmark to manifest. Did you undergo the Test of Siberys or did your mark manifest independently? The following list looks at just a few of the challenges and forms of stress involved in the Test of Siberys.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Mark of Detection.</strong> An interview in which a candidate is locked in a room slowly filling with water, faced with two identical subjects and must determine if either, both, or neither are changelings, and the correct answer yields the key to safety. Many applicants manifest the mark simply from the stress of suffocation, even if they fail the requirements of the test. Since that is the true purpose of the test, such successes are praised just as are those who exit the room with dry boots.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Finding.</strong> A candidate must track a designated target, often through the Shadow Marches and, depending on the skill of the candidate, such extended hunting might involve ever increasingly dangerous beasts. In a city, the test might involve tracking a House mentor. In either case, failure will bring shame on the family, and could involve injury or death, especially if the prey gets the drop on a would-be hunter.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Handling.</strong> The dragonmark allows its bearer to befriend monstrosities, and the most common test is to be locked in a small space with an angry hippogriff. Candidates might also be faced with a stampede of lesser beasts, challenged to wrangle a herd of cats, or otherwise presented with a difficult task involving the handling animals.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Hospitality.</strong> The most common feature of the Mark of Hospitality includes a strong power of persuasion, and the Ghallanda trials largely revolve around high-stakes baking tournaments. In these bake-offs, candidates often aren&rsquo;t given all the ingredients they require, challenging the heirs to either find a way to overcome this handicap through exceptional talent with cook&rsquo;s utensils or to convince the judges that the proposed meal was a subpar selection, and the dish presented is more appropriate to suit the pallet given the ingredients, which likely requires the ability to make fast friends.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Making.</strong> The heir is stranded in a junk heap with a specific challenge that will allow them to escape imprisonment. To accomplish this, the heir must either mend broken equipment or use magecraft to cobble together something entirely new.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Passage.</strong> Speed is the defining feature of the Mark of Passage, and the candidates are often pitted against each other in foot races to deliver packages to the administrators containing letters of their success, dodging iron defenders while wild beasts are set after them. Those who fall behind might suffer a mauling. As a final safeguard against the crafty candidate, an heir that takes too long to deliver the package also carries with it the mark manifesting stress of the explosive properties infused within the parcel.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Scribing.</strong> Some enclaves focus on the translating abilities of the mark, creating tests that require an immediate translation. An heir could be placed in a dire situation such as being poisoned, or locked in an increasingly inhospitable space, left only with incomprehensible instructions that reveal the keys to survival. Others require a perfect act of scribing, which some might call forgery, perfectly duplicating a challenging piece of writing, such as a legal document. Failing this test could very well mean imprisonment, should the authorities happen upon such replication and detect its imperfections.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Sentinel.</strong> Similar to House Jorasco, Sentinel heirs are often paired with dogs or other animals. After a year of bonding, the heir must keep their animal companion alive through a harrowing week of unexpected assaults and hidden threats otherwise impossible without the assistance of a dragonmark.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Shadow.</strong> The heir is sealed in a space with a brutal foe and must successfully evade the enemy for a period. Some enclaves prefer to avoid these tests of stealth and instead focus purely on a display of artistic talent well beyond the level of most professional entertainers.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Storm.</strong> The candidate is stranded in a dinghy on storm-tossed water and must make their way safely to land. If the fear of drowning is not enough to awaken the heir&rsquo;s mark, the fear of being lost at sea is often cited as the catalyst to achieve the desired result.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark of Warding.</strong> A common trial involves heirs being sealed in vaults and abandoned. The candidate works to overcome the locks before succumbing to hunger and thirst. Alternatively, late bloomers might face a dangerous threat approaching in the distance, and the candidate must repair a chamber&rsquo;s locks and enter before it arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"pB6sV6EjvGgN9iBJ"}

These are the house's formative years as an independent entity, and every move you make is watched closely. This is not to say that every heir of Thuranni must actively spy at the behest of house elders, but even the house's most insular artists and artisans are expected to keep up with current political events, and to pass on or collect information when asked.</p>\n<p>By choosing the path of espionage, you are joining a secret society that monitors its agents closely. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Thuranni]{Shadow Network} differs from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Serpentine Table} in both its agenda and its methods, and prospective members are encouraged to remember this. Because of its aggressive techniques, the network relies heavily on the loyalty of its members. As such, serving efficiently and consistently is the surest way to earn the respect of one's peers within the house.</p>\n<p><img class=\"right table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/thuranni-shadow-stalker.webp\" alt=\"A member of House Thuranni\" width=\"355\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>Once a course of action has been determined and set, only death or the direct order of a superior can deter you from carrying it out. Like your Phiarlan kin, you are a master at sizing up your opponents, whether in advance or in the thick of the fight. Whenever possible, you try to set the terms by which combat takes place.</p>\n<p>The Thuranni attitude toward combat dictates that you should always consider whether death is your intention. Assassination is one thing, but a simple escalation of tension should always be resolvable. Arguments should never end with blood spilled, but if death is required, you prefer to deliver it as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p>As a young house, Thuranni can ill afford mistakes&mdash; particularly conspicuous ones. Ambition and talent will take you far in the house, but only espionage work that shows results and goes undetected will see that ambition and talent recognized.</p>\n<p>Because its artistic endeavors are so closely tied to its spying, Thuranni expects its heirs to be as ambitious with their creativity as they are with their undercover work. Heirs should strive to make an impression in their artistic field, and to cultivate a reputation that grants them access to the upper levels of Khorvairian society and the secrets held there.</p>\n<h2>Missions</h2>\n<p>Undertaking missions for the Shadow Network requires strength and certainty in equal proportions. If the companions in your party are not of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni], they need to respect that you have ties you cannot disclose&mdash;or will need to be replaced with new allies. The house has next to no sympathy for those who would jeopardize its existence with even a moment's indiscretion.</p>\n<p>Thuranni chooses its clients and assignments carefully, and any mission you are given will be as important as it is likely dangerous. As with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan], Thuranni agents specialize in making magical observation easier by getting close to targets on the ground. Especially with the house's growing reputation as assassins, the most important part of any mission is to ensure that your work goes undetected.</p>\n<p>Should your work for the house bring you into the service of the Dragon's Path, you can expect your assignments to encompass more than the routine politics of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations] and the dragonmarked houses. The eternal question of what destiny the dragonmarked serve lingers deep in the heart of your house. As a result, you might find yourself engaging in more traditional adventuring&mdash;seeking old lore, reclaiming relics of the past, digging through lost tombs&mdash;in your ongoing search for the secrets of the past and future. Such expeditions might even bring you into contact with the dragons themselves, about whom your superiors are always cautiously interested in learning more.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-thuranni-seal.webp","_id":"pMxny36PIHttKojQ"}

Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers&mdash;anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall&mdash;but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.</p>\n<p>In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.</p>\n<p>There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it&mdash;but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice&mdash;but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.</p>\n<p>Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.</p>\n<p>A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; everyone clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her&mdash;he needs to know better&mdash;but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"q8JW3Dy7upnh7duW"}

Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the skies, and goblins and werewolves lurk in the forests. For centuries it has been an untamed frontier. Then the Daughters of Sora Kell forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of giants and the cunning stonework of the medusas. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and Breland, carved from the foothills of the mountains from which it takes its name. This is Graywall, town of monsters and gateway to Droaam.</p>\n<p>Why come to Graywall?</p>\n<p>Though smaller than Sharn or Stormreach, Graywall is a unique town with much to offer to adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Free Town: </strong>Not only is Droaam not one of the Five Nations&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t even bound by the Treaty of Thronehold. As such, the laws of the east have no weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the Code of Galifar, it is also a source for dangerous goods banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics to surplus weapons of war smuggled from Aundair or Breland. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of the Emerald Claw from making an deal for arcane armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own lucrative bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruins of Dhakaan: </strong>Droaam holds secrets still untouched by human hands. Ruins have lain empty since the Gatekeepers drove the daelkyr into the depths . . . along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces&mdash;natural, aberrant, and undead. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the Age of Monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Home, Unsavory Home:</strong> Many monstrous races make excellent player characters. Minotaurs, gnolls, kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs while doppelgangers and tieflings have an easier time in Droaam than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore Dhakaani ruins, clash with Brelish border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam&rsquo;s many warlords. Alternatively, the minotaur who now wanders across Khorvaire with his human comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.</p>\n<h2>Graywall Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 03 Bloodstone (Sorghun)]{Bloodstone (Sorghun)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 04 The Calabas (The Kennel)]{The Calabas (The Kennel)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 05 Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)]{Little Graywall (Sar Kuraath)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 06 The Deep Door (Khyras)]{The Deep Door (Khyras)}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 01 Life in Graywall]{Life in Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 02 The Shape of Graywall]{The Shape of Graywall}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Graywall: 07 Forces within Graywall]{Forces within Graywall}</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2>LIFE IN GRAYWALL</h2>\n<p>Droaam is a young nation. Just 30 years ago, Graywall was a broken mass of Dhakaani ruins. In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the frontier between the realms of humanity and the land of monsters. During the Last War it became a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those serving as mercenaries with House Tharashk and the warbands raiding Breland. With the war&rsquo;s end, the Daughters of Sora Kell have devoted significant resources to establishing a strong presence on the border of the Five Nations. As a result, Graywall is a booming town. The expansion never ends, since teams of ogres, orcs, and medusas work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry and shift stone, while kobolds and goblins delve in the byeshk mines and toil in the workhouses and fields. Gnoll hunters bring hides and meat in from the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people of the east&mdash;bandits, deserters, merchants, and more, all looking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the Daughters of Sora Kell. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago&mdash;especially for the goblins, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years foreigners have brought the gold of Galifar to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders . . . and to criminals who prey upon them.</p>\n<h3>Common Customs</h3>\n<p>Most of the monstrous inhabitants of Graywall serve Droaam. Sora Katra strives to inspire her people, so that they want to work to create a stronger Droaam&mdash; but where inspiration fails, force is employed. Every work crew has two overseers, a minotaur and a harpy. The minotaur serves as the iron fist when brute force is employed. The harpy calls the team to work and entertains them with her song whenever they are granted a period of rest. A harpy overseer uses the standard harpy statistics, but replaces Stealth with Diplomacy +12 and Insight +10. A minotaur overseer might be a soldier or cabalist depending on the group he is minding; either way he receives a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. A laborer typically serves an 11-hour work shift and engages in an hour of militia drills. Given the choice, most of the inhabitants of the town are nocturnal; however, the work yards and mines run 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>Although the citizens of Droaam are theoretically equal, centuries of tradition and bloodshed have ingrained certain habits in the population. On the streets, monsters typically defer to more powerful creatures, and most citizens have a good sense of this hierarchy. The goblin steps out of the way of the ogre, and the ogre steps aside for the troll. Frequently this breaks down to size, but there are definite exceptions to this rule. Even a troll steps out of a medusa&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>People of the Five Nations might find the casual presence of deadly creatures to be unnerving. Although they are relatively rare, medusas walk the streets of Graywall. A female medusa keeps her eyes closed, observing the world through her serpent mane; lacking this option, a male medusa typically ties a strip of gauze loosely across his eyes to protect others from his deadly gaze. But it is easy enough for an angry medusa to pull away the gauze, or for a harpy to raise her voice. In practice, this rarely occurs; Xorchylic has no patience for monsters that kill without reason, and the people of Droaam know better than to provoke their deadly fellow citizens. A medusa can kill with a gaze, just as a wizard in Sharn could fling a fireball into a crowd. But neither is likely to do so unless provoked.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Though united under the Daughters of Sora Kell, the creatures of Droaam have wildly diverse cultures. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have sent envoys to Graywall, but in the past they have had infrequent contact with the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne or the gnolls of the Znir Pact. As a result, little religious solidarity exists in Graywall. A host of tiny shrines are scattered throughout Bloodstone and Little Graywall, and they represent the deities of different clans and races. The minotaurs of the north are united in worship of the Horned Prince, but each clan has their own representation of this demon overlord and believes all others to be flawed. The Last Dirge harpies revere the Song of Passion and Rage&mdash;an interpretation of the Fury&mdash;while the Stormsinger harpies venerate the Stormsong, an aspect of the Devourer. The asymmetric icons of the Traveler hold hidden messages for doppelgangers who pass through Graywall. The Znir gnolls worship no deity or demon, instead raising piles of stones to reflect the idols shattered by their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Although each group has their own personal patrons and beliefs, a few forces are respected throughout the nation. The greatest of these is the Shadow. The priests of the Shadow are typically medusas or oni, and they teach that the Shadow created the monstrous races, granting his children powers that Aureon and the selfish Sovereigns withheld from humanity. So far the Voices of the Shadow have largely supported the Daughters of Sora Kell, and these priests frequently serve as community leaders.</p>\n<p>The Mockery is also revered by monsters of many species, but his followers are more aggressive. Priests of the Mockery frequently incite violence against the people of the east, and woe betide the foreigner who encounters a pack of Skinners at midnight in Bloodstone.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures of Droaam are indifferent toward the Sovereign Host and their worshipers. They consider the Sovereigns to be weak and selfish gods, and see their worship as more laughable than offensive. The Silver Flame is another story. Champions and crusaders of the Silver Flame have frequently invaded Droaam over the last four centuries, and the people of Graywall have no intention of forgiving these old trespasses. Anyone who openly wears a symbol of the Silver Flame is met with great hostility. Outside the Calabas, this dramatically increases the chance of street violence. Even if nobody attacks him, the PC take a &ndash;5 penalty to skill checks or challenges involving Diplomacy or Streetwise, and any perceived allies of his take a &ndash;3 penalty to these checks because of the association.</p>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Droaam stands outside the Code of Galifar and the Treaty of Galifar. There is no uniform code of justice in Droaam; instead, the law lies solely in the hands of the designated representatives of the Daughters of Sora Kell. In Droaam, this is Xorchylic, an ancient mind flayer. Xorchylic personally commands the Flayer Guard, a force of ogres, orcs, and minotaurs supplemented by harpies, gargoyles, and a squad of war trolls trained by Sora Maenya. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary gnolls of the Znir Pact, as well his allies within House Tharashk.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town. PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that directly inconveniences Xorchylic. This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn&rsquo;t recognize the laws of other lands and won&rsquo;t punish Brelish bandits who take sanctuary in his town. But neither will he call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them . . . unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious crimes are punished with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to go. It&rsquo;s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses his mental powers to punish offenders; some say he implants phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.</p>\n<p>Although there are no written laws, the people of Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before a medusa magistrate. If the magistrate considers the case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light&mdash;but many of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that they have a voice.</p>\n<p>Xorchylic has granted House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas. Baron Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of orc soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs ogre, gargoyle, and gnoll mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the Calabas. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the plaintiff to employ the services of Tharashk inquisitives. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.</p>\n<h3>The Economy</h3>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell have yet to mint coins. Most merchants willingly accept the gold of the east, especially in the Calabas; however, they are also used to bartering for goods and services. Gnoll hunters trade food and meat. Miners might offer slivers of precious metal or rough, low-value gemstones. Another common token of value is the tooth of a dangerous animal. The Daughters offer a bounty on feral creatures that pose a threat to travel and trade, and they reward hunters for turning in the teeth of kills; as a result, teeth have become a form of currency. A common practice is to inscribe the type of creature on the tooth in either Giant or Goblin, but most merchants don&rsquo;t accept teeth for barter unless they personally recognize the beast.</p>\n<p>As a DM, consider the bartering system of Droaam&rsquo;s markets as an opportunity to plant adventure hooks. Although a merchant in Bloodstone might be willing to accept gold for his goods, odds are high that he has little gold with which to purchase treasures from adventurers. However, he could offer an ancient Dhakaani statue that the group&rsquo;s historian thinks is worth considerably more than what they have to trade&mdash;although to receive its full value, they have to travel to Darguun! Merchants could offer maps leading to fabled ruins, scrolls of Dhakaani lore, or strange relics of the Daelkyr that have never been identified. They might also possess relics from the Last War, which were goods pawned by or stolen from soldiers of the Five Nations. This could be a source of treasures the PCs couldn&rsquo;t acquire in a dungeon, or it could set the stage for a story. For instance, a widow wants to recover a family heirloom lost by a soldier last seen in Graywall. As a result, the markets of Graywall might have surprising opportunities for even high-level characters. The oni merchant might not have the gold to deal with a paragon-level PC&mdash;but it might have treasures the PCs want.</p>\n<p>Droaam&rsquo;s primary export is byeshk ore. However, people frequently come to Droaam to deal in less savory goods. Bandits&mdash;both monstrous raiders and Brelish deserters&mdash;sell their spoils in the goblin markets. Droaam is also the source of a variety of potent alchemical substances; however, all these are addictive and carry side effects severe enough that wise PCs avoid them. Dragon&rsquo;s blood enhances arcane powers, but carries the risk of burning out a caster from within. Courage is a stimulant that helps the user overcome fear, a useful thing in a town of monsters . . . but over time it promotes paranoia, ultimately leaving the user in a catatonic state of sheer terror. Blood gin is a powerful necrotic narcotic. The berries used to give blood gin its flavor and potency must be steeped in the blood of a murdered sentient being, and those who drink the gin have visions drawn from the life of the victim, mixed in with the overall euphoria and lassitude imparted by the drug. Withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations and nightmares, frequently involving the circumstances of the original victim&rsquo;s murder. Traffic in all these substances is illegal in the Five Nations, but expatriates and exiles have become addicted to blood gin, and the criminal organization Daask has opened a few hidden gin dens in Breland and Aundair.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Calabas, the people of Graywall are largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the arena. Other forms of entertainment vary by species. Goblins enjoy song and music. The changelings of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. Ogres love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers wandering through Bloodstone might come upon a group of ogres holding massive stones over their heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love to gamble, and it&rsquo;s common to see teeth or other bartering tokens scattered on the ground around an impromptu match.</p>\n<p>In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: harpy song. This is provided as a public service in the grist mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a &ldquo;songbird.&rdquo; When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Food and Drink</h3>\n<p>An expatriate from the east can find familiar foods in the inns and taverns of the Calabas. If he ventures into Bloodstone or the other districts of Graywall, he can find more disturbing fare. Most of it is perfectly edible, though many Droaamites like their meat to be squirming. Other dishes are incompatible with the human digestive tract. Trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tendrils, which can paralyze a typical human. Many dishes are also served with a tiny ooze, which is swallowed to help digestion. However, stories have circulated that tell of poorly prepared oozes eating their way out of a diner&rsquo;s stomach.</p>\n<p>The Daughters of Sora Kell provide their laborers with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls known as &ldquo;grist mills.&rdquo; This name is drawn from the primary dish&mdash;a form of ground meat called grist, prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is tough and has a sour taste that dwarves find especially offensive, but it is filling and the mills have a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any idea where grist comes from, and of those who do, few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist is ground troll meat. Each mill includes a stable of imprisoned trolls. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Troll meat contains a number of minor toxins that normally render it inedible. However, the Daughters of Sora Kell possess the answer to this dilemma. A secret blend of herbs and spices is mixed in with the meat as it is ground up, and this counteracts the nauseating effects . . . though adventurers might still be revolted when they learn what they are eating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"rKSCXB3jS0yfh6sG"}

Some twenty-six hundred years ago, a significant number of elves migrated to Khorvaire in the wake of the civil war in Aerenal that destroyed the line of Vol. Where elf and human settlements came into close proximity, intermarriage became common. However, when the earliest generations of halfelves were born, a good number of the elf settlers rejected them, leaving a population of half-caste children spread across human lands. Over the next six hundred years, this population grew.</p>\n<p>According to house doctrine, the founders of Lyrandar were chosen by the gods themselves. The half-elves Lyran and Selavash were the first to manifest the Mark of Storm, both claiming to have received their marks accompanied by visions of the sovereign lords Arawai and Kol Korran. The sovereigns hailed the duo as the true children of Khorvaire. The half-elves were a race made strong through their hybrid blood, and would wield power over both nature and commerce.</p>\n<p>In the decades that followed, Lyran and Selavash traveled across Khorvaire, preaching their vision to others of their kind. Tales of miracles performed by the pair are common, but all that can be said for certain is that both possessed an almost supernatural ability to inspire others of their race. The charismatic duo encouraged half-elves to form their own separate communities and to recognize themselves as a unique race&mdash;the Khoravar, or \"Children of Khorvaire.\" Their followers began to call Selavash and Lyran the Firstborn, naming themselves \"children of Lyran,\" or Lyrandar.</p>\n<p>As proscribed marriage within the Khoravar community began to make Lyrandar a line of related families, the Mark of Storm spread through those families with great speed. Those blessed by this magic soon became House Lyrandar, operating a small fleet of swift ships and providing fair weather to farmers in need. Long after Selavash and Lyran had passed away, legends of the Firstborn continued to spread. To this day, a good number of Lyrandar believe that the spirits of the founders still guide the house.</p>\n<p>Like many dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar's fortunes have shifted with the end of the Last War. The Korth Edicts placed limits on the houses owning land and maintaining military forces, but with the collapse of Galifar, Lyrandar has been able to circumvent both restrictions. The house owns a number of stormships (described in Explorer's Handbook), ostensibly to defend its fleets against piracy. The house has also developed extensive holdings in Valenar, and appears to have considerable influence there.</p>\n<h2>The Kraken Prince</h2>\n<p>The seal of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar] is a kraken surrounded by four lightning bolts, commonly attributed to one of the best-known tales of the Firstborn. In this legend, Lyran is at sea when his ship is set upon by a fleet of four reaver vessels. Lyran warns the pirates that he holds the blessing of Arawai, but they do not listen. Moments later, a kraken rises from the depths, summoning lighting to shatter the pirate vessels as Lyran's ship speeds safely on.</p>\n<p>Beyond the common legend, the less well-known doctrine of the Storm Front (see page 50) claims that the Firstborn did not die but became immortal krakens, and that this is a state any Lyrandar heir can reach. According to this tale, the kraken lords remain in the depths of the sea, guiding the Storm Front by way of dreams and visions as they help their descendants achieve true dominance over the waves.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-lyrandar-seal.webp","_id":"rmIbQe54CnLjEUBl"}

Galifar had a vision for a unified empire that stretched across Khorvaire, and he trained his family for the many wars of conquest that would be required to establish his dream.

Along the way, Galifar also trained them for the peace that would follow, honing five visionary leaders as he honed his weapons and troops for every battle.</p>\n<p>Galifar's eldest daughter, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair], governed the northwestern portion of the kingdom and helped shape the region that would eventually bear her name.</p>\n<p>The southwestern portion of the kingdom became the domain of Brey, Galifar's second daughter. During her reign, the region came to be called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland].</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre], youngest son of Galifar, governed the southeastern portion of the kingdom and gave his name to the region in 32 YK.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], the eastern region of the kingdom, was turned over to Galifar's eldest scion, Karrn, to govern. This area was the original seat of Galifar's power, and it was only natural that his oldest son would be granted control of the area.</p>\n<p>The southern portion of the kingdom became the domain of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane], Galifar's middle son. As with the other nations, the region adopted the name of its governor-prince in 32 YK.</p>\n<p>For almost a thousand years, the great kingdom of Galifar rose atop the pillars of the Five Nations to create an unprecedented age of peace and prosperity. For almost a thousand years, the scions of the kingdom governed the Five Nations and followed the rites of succession as put forth by Galifar the First during his forty-year reign. This honored tradition was abandoned a century ago, when the last king of Galifar, Jarot, died. For the first time in the history of the kingdom, the scions refused to honor the rites of succession. Each governor-prince eventually decided to claim the throne and the crown for himself or herself, and the kingdom broke apart in all-out war.</p>\n<p>To understand the Five Nations as they exist today (in the year 998 YK as reckoned by the people of Khorvaire), it helps to understand the history of this important region.</p>\n<h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE FIVE NATIONS</h2>\n<p>Humans arrived in eastern Khorvaire some three thousand years ago. They traveled across the Sea of Rage, leaving Sarlona for reasons that have been lost to the passing years. For the next thousand years, humans spread westward, struggling with the goblinoid tribes for the best portions of the land. Eventually, five major human settlements arose in central Khorvaire. These would become the Five Nations.</p>\n<p>For five hundred years, the five human settlements grew and fought with the neighboring goblinoids&mdash;the remnants of the once-powerful Dhakaani Empire. Then, two thousand years ago, human imperialism began. Karrn the Conqueror established the first human nation, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], along the northeastern shores of the great five-spoked river that divided the central continent. His armies defeated and drove the remaining goblinoids to the south. Then he turned his attention on his human neighbors.</p>\n<p>Karrn the Conqueror was a cruel and covetous man who believed that he was destined to rule over all of Khorvaire. He had built the most powerful human army up to that time, and after defeating the goblinoids he began a campaign to conquer the other four major human settlements. Karrn swept south, ostensibly to drive the remaining goblinoids into the wild regions, but actually invading the region that would one day become @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]. Caught by surprise, the region fell to Karrn. With two nations now claimed as part of his empire, Karrn's forces massed on the border of what would one day be called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane] and demanded the nation's immediate surrender.</p>\n<p>Before Karrn could claim another victory, the remaining three nations joined forces to stop the Conqueror's spread. What emerged from the carnage were five distinct human nations that spent the next thousand years alternately working together, competing for space and resources, and ultimately setting the stage for the great human civilization to come.</p>\n<p>Of course, while humans were the most numerous and in many of the key positions of power, the other common races participated in the rise of the Five Nations. Thanks to the growing economic strength of the dragonmarked houses, all the common races found a place in the developing human countries. Dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, and half-orcs started out as representatives and employees of their respective dragonmarked houses, but eventually members of each race settled down and made homes in the Five Nations. These neighborhoods began as house enclaves, becoming less attached to the houses as the common race populations in the nations grew.</p>\n<p>If Karrn taught the people of the Five Nations anything, he taught them to establish national identities. For a thousand years, the Five Nations expanded and developed unique personalities. And they adopted names to further distinguish themselves from each other.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Five Nations Names</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Pre-Galifar Name</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Galifar/Current Name</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thaliost</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wroat</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metrol</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]/Mournland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Daskara</td>\n<td>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>THE COMING OF GALIFAR</h2>\n<p>Galifar Wynarn, of the bloodline of Karrn the Conqueror, entered the world one thousand and fortythree years ago, born to the warlord of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]. Galifar assumed leadership of the nation just before his twenty-first birthday, upon the death of his father. He grew up during the Border Wars, a decade-long conflict that saw the Five Nations battle over land rights and water sources. He saw the cruelty and shortsightedness of the warlords, including his father, and he decided that those currently in charge were wasting the potential of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p>Galifar envisioned a united kingdom made up of five equal parts, where petty disagreements were put aside and the people worked to improve life and advance the human condition. Young Galifar studied the exploits of his famous ancestor and decided that in many ways Karrn had the right idea. Only by combining their resources and efforts could the nations achieve the next level of civilization. Where Karrn failed, in Galifar's opinion, was in his cruelty, his blood lust, and his desire for aggrandizement above all other concerns. Galifar swore to avoid these failings and find a higher purpose to lead the way.</p>\n<p>During the first decade of his rule over @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], Galifar began preparations to see his dream become a reality. While Galifar hoped to convince the Five Nations to accept his plan, he knew that his best chance of uniting the kingdom was to have a powerful army to assure compliance. He expanded the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath] military and set the best minds in the nation to helping him plan the kingdom he envisioned building. Then, in the eighth year of his reign, he began negotiations with the leaders of the other nations. It didn't take the other warlords long to reject Galifar and his plans for a unified kingdom.</p>\n<p>Undeterred, Galifar continued to explore diplomatic approaches to unity for the next two years. Each demonstration of shortsightedness and refusal on the parts of the other warlords simply made Galifar more determined to bring his vision to reality. On the tenth anniversary of his rise to power in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath], Galifar began a military campaign to build the kingdom he dreamed of. For the next fourteen years, this campaign would rage across central Khorvaire. During this period, Galifar demonstrated his military genius time and time again, and his children grew to become his chief lieutenants as each reached the appropriate age.</p>\n<p>While Galifar and his forces didn't win every battle in the war to establish the kingdom, they did win the most important ones. Over the course of the war, the warlord-who-would-be-king made two influential diplomatic ploys that helped ensure his eventual victory. The first was to take the dragonmarked houses out of the conflict and gain their support by offering them special status in the new kingdom. The second was to take his dream directly to the people of the Five Nations, allowing him to slowly win the hearts and minds of those he hoped to lead.</p>\n<p>Fourteen years after the war began, the Five Nations laid down their arms and surrendered to Galifar. True to his word, Galifar didn't come as a conqueror from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]&mdash;he proclaimed himself king of a new kingdom composed of five equal parts. (Originally, it was simply \"the Kingdom\" or \"Galifar's Kingdom.\" It didn't officially adopt the name Galifar until the second decade of the king's rule.) To ensure loyalty and to push his postwar programs, he appointed each of his five children to manage the affairs of the Five Nations. As governor-princes, they would administer their portions of the realm in his name, as well as serve on a ruling council that would advise and support the new king. It helped that, in the end, the common folk respected and grew to love Galifar and his scions, seeing them as just, fair, and ultimately visionary rulers.</p>\n<p>Galifar established that the oldest living scion would ascend to the throne upon the ruler's death or abdication, whichever came first. Thus, the traditions and patterns surrounding the succession of power were set in place, helping to keep the kingdom going until King Jarot's scions broke the pattern in 894 YK.</p>\n<h2>THE LAST WAR</h2>\n<p>King Jarot, the last king of the great Kingdom of Galifar, set the stage for the fall of the kingdom and the start of the Last War. Dark dreams of a terrible future plagued Jarot, and paranoia slowly filled his every thought as time went on. He feared the dragonmarked houses. He believed that his aristocracy and nobility were plotting against him. He hated the realm of Aerenal, totally convinced that the ancestor-worshiping elves coveted his beloved domain. To these concerns, Jarot added the threats he believed were watching from distant Argonnessen and Riedra, waiting for the first sign of weakness before they launched devastating attacks. Worst of all, in Jarot's mind, were the unknown horrors that filled the mysterious continent of Xen'drik. Nightmares of this strange land haunted him, and deep down he knew that the ruination of his realm would come from that direction.</p>\n<p>Without revealing his overt fears, but with a desire to protect the kingdom and its people from the threats he believed were amassing all around him, King Jarot began a series of public works projects and secret experiments designed to reinforce the kingdom's infrastructure and borders while also increasing its capacity for war. Out of these projects were born the warforged, the floating fortresses of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland], and other magical wonders. During the same period, the lightning rail expanded throughout the kingdom, and Jarot's beloved and trusted children&mdash;the governorprinces of the Five Nations&mdash;increased their standing armies and magical arsenals. And then the kingdom waited for the war Jarot feared was approaching like a chill breeze on a hot, still night.</p>\n<p>The war that Jarot feared never erupted during his life. However, thanks in no small part to the preparations he orchestrated, it broke out with his death. The war, proclaimed to be the Last War by the Korranberg Chronicle, was fought not against some terrible external enemy&mdash;it was fought among the Five Nations as the Kingdom of Galifar collapsed from within.</p>\n<p>In 894 YK, King Jarot died. His scions decided to break with tradition, using the armies they had fostered to take the crown for themselves. For more than a century, the Five Nations were at war. Other nations arose during the conflict, shattering Galifar's dream into more than a dozen fragments. In the end, no single victor emerged. Instead, compromises were reached and a treaty was drawn up to put a stop to the endless battles. Now, in 998 YK, the fragile peace holds&mdash;but for how long?</p>\n<h2>THE FIVE NATIONS TODAY</h2>\n<p>The Last War officially ended two years ago with the signing of the Treaty of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thronehold]. Four years ago, the nation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre] disappeared in a terrible and unexplained conflagration that turned the entire area into a devastated region now known as the Mournland. Today, in addition to the remaining four of the Five Nations, the old kingdom has been divided into fifteen distinct countries, twelve of which were recognized by the historic treaty.</p>\n<p>In the largest cities of Khorvaire, idealists rejoice that the war has finally ended. Lightning rails and trade roads are once again open to those with the money and means to travel. Marketplaces again bustle with merchandise and goods from all corners of the continent. Only five years ago, a noble would have paid handsomely to enjoy Brelish cheese and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundairian} wine in the same meal, but now such trade is once again common. At the same table where such a meal is shared, ideas and tales are exchanged, and many learn about nations and people they were once taught to fear.</p>\n<p>For all the open smiles and friendly handshakes, old grudges do not die easily. The Five Nations have a century of dark memories of rivalries and atrocities to put behind them, and forgetting such things is never easy. For every border that has been moved, someone's home or family has been displaced. For every battle lost or won, someone's loved one has died. Friendships and alliances may still defy national boundaries, but there are those who plot retribution and renewed mayhem.</p>\n<p>Cities such as Sharn demonstrate an ability to live openly with representatives of all nations, races, and ideologies, but such progressive thinking doesn't extend across the countryside. Can you help extend this period of peace and hold off the flames of the next war? No matter where you start on the map, a world of adventure awaits. Let's explore the Five Nations!</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"vhRYTiAaNhFlWI3X"}

The house acts as a managing company, keeping its share of the profits and overseeing the guilds' decision-making processes. Most members of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] work for one guild or the other. Nonguild members of the house typically deal with the other houses or the governments of Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Couriers GUILD</h2>\n<p>The Couriers Guild serves both the rich and poor of Khorvaire, though the common folk arguably benefit the most from it. For a reasonable fee, the guild arranges safe transportation for letters or packages. Lightning rail cargo runs cover Khorvaire's major centers and the smaller settlements en route, while Orien caravans serve more remote areas. In addition, the Couriers Guild can arrange express shipping, guaranteeing the fastest service and personal delivery at the recipient's end. For its most exclusive clients (and at its most expensive rates), the guild guarantees safe, nextday delivery of any parcel small enough to be carried by the courier charged with teleporting to its destination.</p>\n<p>As a side service, the guild also employs an elite group of agents who specialize in secure and high-risk delivery scenarios. If the destination is dangerous or remote, or if the item or information to be shipped cannot be entrusted to the rail or the open road, the Couriers Guild has options for those who can afford them.</p>\n<p>Couriers typically undertake a good number of low-risk assignments before they are entrusted with sensitive documents or goods. All couriers undergo a thorough investigation of their character before becoming members of the guild. Those who have proven their worth and are of sufficient experience can become special couriers, taking on high-profile assignments.</p>\n<h2>Transportation Guild</h2>\n<p>The Transportation Guild is responsible for lightning rail, caravan, and coach routes throughout Khorvaire, including the maintenance of trade roads and courier posts. Tariff agreements made with the nations through which its lines run fund the guild. Taxes paid by the settlements where stops are located go toward station maintenance. Passenger fares and shipping fees on the lightning rail, coaches, and caravans are used for general maintenance, salaries, and overhead, and to boost House Orien's bottom line.</p>\n<p>While the Couriers Guild is a valuable part of Orien's business, the Transportation Guild is the house's financial foundation. Nearly everyone involved with house operations works in the Transportation Guild at some point. Piloting a lightning rail is the most glamorous and prized job in the guild, but beneath every pilot are hundreds of guild operatives whose work keeps the rail running. Orien does not make its employment numbers public, but it is widely surmised that the Transportation Guild is the largest guild in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Transportation Guild's teleportation services are typically available only at house enclaves. Once the province of nobles and the dragonmarked viceroys, teleportation has taken on a new significance for Orien in the aftermath of the Last War. In the age of exploration, a new class of adventurers and mercenary heroes often has the need (and the coin) to hire those Orien heirs with the greater or Siberys Mark of Passage. In particular, the greater teleport ability of a Siberys heir allows instantaneous travel from mainland Khorvaire to the wilds and riches of Xen'drik. Faced with the prospect of a dangerous, monthlong voyage across the Thunder Sea, many an adventuring party is willing to cobble together the cost required to teleport directly from Sharn to Stormreach.</p>\n<p>As they did all through the Last War, Orien teleporters continue to do a steady trade with the nobility and the dragonmarked houses. The politics of Khorvaire have never been in greater flux, and the ability to instantly meet with one's allies&mdash;or just as instantly send spies into the court of one's foes&mdash;is the foundation of the alliances and intrigue that make up the modern age.</p>\n<h2>Other Organizations</h2>\n<p><strong>Trailblazers:</strong> Someone needs to lay the conductor stones, identify demi-planes, and plant the runic anchors. The Trail blazers are the scouts who explore new routes and lay the first stones. A player character who has ties to the house could easily be called in to work with the Trailblazers.</p>\n<p><strong>Unicorn's Horn: </strong>Even though @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Orien] employs @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Deneith]{Deneith} mercenaries for general security, the house maintains an elite force to deal with high-risk situations. Among the members of the Unicorn's Horn are the Hands of Orien, dragonmarked heirs who have learned to use their mark to warp time and space.</p>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/dragonmarks/house-orien-caravan.webp\" alt=\"House Orien caravan\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/symbols/house-orien-seal.webp","_id":"vyK4myoxnqxs2MFr"}

{"name":"1-4: The Economy of Droaam","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ayjyio0mtj8","path":"Savage Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/Nations of Khorvaire#/CF_SEP/Droaam","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>The Economy of Droaam</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth&mdash;so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage&mdash;\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"&mdash;adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam&mdash;or is perhaps even an ally&mdash;there won't be a bounty on its teeth.</p>\n<p>While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter&mdash;any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.</p>\n<p>Droaam's main exports&mdash;brokered through House Tharashk&mdash; are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!</p>\n<p>In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the Droaamish Artisanship table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"x5Ol933dZdqGkPkX"}
{"name":"1-1: What Defines Droaam?","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_ayjyio0mtj8","path":"Savage Eberron Lore#/CF_SEP/Nations of Khorvaire#/CF_SEP/Droaam","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>What Defines Droaam?</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride&mdash;driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"</p>\n<p>Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs&mdash; miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.</p>\n<p>While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist&mdash;ground meat made of troll flesh&mdash;that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder&mdash;the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.</p>\n<p>When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.</p>\n<p>Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common&mdash;and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma (Performance) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.</p>\n<p>Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.</p>\n<p>While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in muut or atcha, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms chaat'oor or gath'dar to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use aravaat&mdash;easterner&mdash;to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.</p>\n<h3>Cruel World</h3>\n<p>Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey&mdash;and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.</p>\n<p>Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.</p>\n<p>This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.</p>\n<p>While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish&mdash;for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.</p>\n<p>Every major town has a \"grist mill\"&mdash;a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate&mdash;though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily&mdash;stew, sausage, meat broth&mdash;but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew&mdash; there's plenty more where it came from!</p>\n<p>For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.</p>\n<h3>Wide Monster</h3>\n<p>It's commonly said that Eberron is \"wide magic, not high magic.\" The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society&mdash;communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster&mdash; finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Harpy Song.</strong> The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted \"songbird\" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicine. </strong>The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is \"suck it up,\" but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce troll's blood, it could revolutionize public health.</p>\n<p><strong>Brute Force.</strong> With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"xRvuF0M8cob00hdW"}
