A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h2>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h2>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h2>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h2>\n<p>The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dwarven Resilience:</strong>&nbsp;Dwarves are hardy and resistanct to toxins. They gain a +4 bonus to resist the effects of poison. Damage from poison is also reduced by 4.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages: </strong>Dwarves start with a d8 in Dwarvish.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarves ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Pace:</strong>&nbsp;Dwarves have short legs compared to most races. Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.</li>\n<li><strong>Stability:&nbsp;</strong>+2 bonus to opposed Strength rolls for performing and resisting Push attacks or Agility rolls for resisting Atheletics Tests or Grapples.</li>\n<li><strong>Stonecunning:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarves add 2 to Notice rolls related to stonework and mechanical work. They also add 2 to Common Knowledge rolls also related to stonework or mechanical work.</li>\n<li><strong>Tough:</strong> Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a d6 Vigor instead of a d4.

Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving.</p>\n<p>Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h2>Elves and Dragonmarks</h2>\n<p>The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h2>Gnomes of Zilargo</h2>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to Zilargo: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h2>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h2>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h2>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h2>\n<p>The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong>&nbsp;Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their Size (and therefore Toughness) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Gnome Cunning:&nbsp;</strong>Gnomes are intelligent creatures. They begin play with a d6 Smarts instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Smarts to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Illusionist:</strong>&nbsp;Gnomes inherently have Arcane Background (Gifted) and know the&nbsp;<em>illusion&nbsp;</em>power. They also have a d4 in Focus (Spirit). They cannot take the New Power Edge for this racial ability, but they can take Power Points.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;Gnomes start with a d8 in Gnomish.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision:</strong>&nbsp;Gnomes&nbsp;ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Pace:&nbsp;</strong>Gnomes have short legs compared to human-sized races.

Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h2>Khorvar</h2>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h2>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h2>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the Mark of Detection is found in House Medani and the Mark of Storm in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.</p>\n<p>With the Mark of Storm, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the Mark of Detection to offer services of personal protection</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heritage:&nbsp;</strong>Half-elves may retain the grace of their elven parent or the adaptability of their human ancestry. A half-elf may either start with a free Novice Edge of his choice or a d6 in Agility instead of a d4 (which also increases his Agility maximum to d12+1).</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:&nbsp;</strong>Half-elves start with a d8 in Elvish.</li>\n<li><strong>Low-Light Vision:</strong> Half-elves ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Skilled:</strong> Sharing the ingenuity of their human relatives as well as having slightly longer life spans, half-elves start with a d4 in any skill based on their experiences, education, training, or culture. If the chosen skill is a core skill, skill), it starts at d6 and the skill's maximum increases to d12+1.</li>\n</ul>","_id":"jXyePATMjlGHs4Av"}

But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Talenta Halflings</h2>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your re'lationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Halflings of the Five Nations</h2>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Halfling's average only about four feet tall, reducing their Size (and therefore Toughness) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages: </strong>Halflings start with a d8 in Halfling.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Pace:</strong> Halflings have short legs compared to human-sized races. Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.</li>\n<li><strong>Shared Luck:&nbsp;</strong>Halfling draw one additional Benny per game session. The halfling may freely share their bennies with any other character he can communicate with.</li>\n<li><strong>Spirited: </strong>Halflings are generally optimistic beings. They start with a d6 Spirit instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Spirit to d12+1.</li>\n</ul>","_id":"dMJKx9ptKMBKWh2P"}

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>The Ghaal'dar</h2>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h2>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h2>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Languages: </strong>Hobgoblins start with a d8 in Goblin.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision: </strong>Hobgoblins ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Martial Training:</strong> Hobgoblin are trained in war as soon as they can hold a weapon in their hand. They start with a d4 in one skill of their choice from Athletics, Battle, Fighting, Intimidation, or Shooting. If the skill is a core skill this will increase the skill's maximum to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Warrior Trained: </strong>Hobgoblins are born and bred as warriors and leaders.

During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries.

Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h2>The Beast Within</h2>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h2>Similiar and Diverse</h2>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h2>The Journey Yet to Come</h2>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keen Senses:&nbsp;</strong>Shifters begin with a d6 Notice skill. The maximum of this skill to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Shifters eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark illumination.</li>\n<li><strong>Shifting (Minor Shape Change):&nbsp;</strong>This ability allows a shifter to tap into his lycanthropic heritage. At character creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting is a free action and lasts 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1 Wound penalty. When the shifting ends, the shifter must wait 4 hours before shifting again or suffer a level of fatigue when the second shifting ends. This level of Fatigue can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from shifting. If the shifter uses this ability again during the recovery time, it inflicts another level of Fatigue that requires an additional 4 hours of recovery time.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide:</strong> The skin of beasthide shifters harden, providing Armor +4.</li>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk: </strong>The limbs, hands, and feet of cliffwalk shifters become stronger, allowing cliffwalk shifters to add +2 to Athletics (climbing) rolls, and climb at their full Pace.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight:</strong> Dreamsight shifters' instincts and awareness become heightened, granting them the beast friend power. The power affects animals of Size +1 or smaller as well as swarms of Small size.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p>\n<p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne-a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam-is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>\n<h2>Living Steel and Stone</h2>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Warforged Personality</h2>\n<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose-such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land-and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>\n<p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Built for War:</strong> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war. Negotiations were not part of their training, and their world knowledge off of the battlefield is limited. They do not have Common Knowledge and Persuasion as core skills.</li>\n<li><strong>Composite Plating: </strong>A warforged is covered in tough plating made of magically-treated woods and metals. Warforged gain a +2 Armor. Warforged are unable to wear additional armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Living Construct:</strong> Warforged are living constructs made from organic and inorganic matter and are capable of emotions and conscious thought. They do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to poison and disease. Warforged also don't need to sleep, and arcane powers can't put them to sleep; however, they must spend at least six hours in a relaxed state. In this state, warforged remain conscious, can see and hear as normal, and can perform simple tasks including using the Repair skill on themselves. Warforged cannot heal naturally, and characters using the healing power or Healing skill on them subtract 4 from the respective rolls. A warforged can be mended with the repairing power or the Repair skill. Each attempt of the Repair skill takes one hour per current Wound level and ignores the \"Golden Hour.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Loyal (Minor): </strong>Warforged are trained to protect their allies in combat, and will always be the first to come to their rescue.</li>\n<li><strong>Outsider (Major): </strong>With a history of being dedicated soldiers of war, warforged have difficulty blending into post-war Khorvaire. Most non-warforged strongly dislike the sight of warforged as they stand as living reminders of the horror that was the Last War. As such, warforged have -2 to Persuasion rolls when interacting with non-warforged and are often treated as less than.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Design:</strong> Warforged are typically designed for specific purposes. They start with a d4 in any skill based on their experiences, education, training. If the chosen skill is a core skill, it starts at d6 and the skills maximum increases to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Steel Fists:</strong> Warforged fists are Natural Weapons (page 104) that cause Strength+d4 damage.</li>\n</ul>","_id":"V1znWqOIto5IClt7"}
