Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p>\n<p>When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p>\n<p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p>\n<h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3>\n<p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p>\n<p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member ofyour adventuring party.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Drow are graceful and agile.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p>\n<h3>City Goblins</h3>\n<p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the&nbsp;<em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

Magic, both light and dark, flows through everything. The study and use of it has happpened by mystical beings such as dragons and Overlords, since the birth of the World ro present times. Much of this study and use has gone into pooling the energy into items of power.</p>\n<h3>Detecting Magic Items</h3>\n<p>Unless a magic item is \"always on\" and has a visible effect (such as a sword with a fire trapping) or produces an obvious effect when experimented with (such as a ring of invisibility making the wearer unseen the moment he slips it on), it can be difficult to tell mundane items from magical ones.</p>\n<p>An @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} roll can be made to decern that an item is in fact magical. Alternately <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal]{Detect (with Arcana trapping)}</em> reveals that an object is magical. Neither option identifies specific powers or benefits within an object.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Identifying Powers of Magical Items</h3>\n<p>There are two methods for determining what powers reside within an item. First, an arcane spellcaster can deduce the powers within an item simply through study. How long it takes is up to you, but a few minutes for a potion (given some basic testing equipment or a more dangerous taste test) and an hour for other items is usually enough.</p>\n<p>Second, <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Object Reading]{Object Reading}</em> will reveal the powers of any object the spellcaster is touching when he casts the spell. This would be seperate from the casting to determine if the item is in fact magical, and means a mage might need to cast it twice (once to detect magic and once to scrutinize).</p>\n<h3>Attuning</h3>\n<p>A hero who wishes to wield a magica item and benefit from it's power must first attune himself. Attunement can only happen after knowledge of the items powers and benefits has been discerned.</p>\n<p>In game terms, the adventurer must spend a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} to access the magic item's abilities and bonuses. If another character wishes to use the item, he must spend a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} to access its abilities as well. No @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny}, no magical powers.</p>\n<p>An adventurer who cannot use the device for some reason, cannot learn the device's powers and does not \"waste\" a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} trying. A ring that can only be used by a follower of the Silver Flame, for instance, remains unusable to a warrior who follows the Cults of the Dragon Below.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.125em;\">Kinds of Magical items</span></h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Alchemical Devices:</strong>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Alchemical devices are magical creations. All he must do to actually use the power it contains is follow any instructions, such as drink a beneficial potion, point a wand at a foe, or read a scroll (unless he is Illiterate).</span> &nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Artificer Items:</strong> These magical items grant @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Edges] or bonuses to Skills or Damage. Artificer items require no activation roll to use any of the powers contained in the item. They grant the user a flat bonus to the appropiate skill. The user receives the bonus whenever he makes the skill roll. For example, a warrior need only swing his longsword to receive any bonus to his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Fighting] roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Minor Artifacts:</strong> Artifacts always require an activation roll using the relic&rsquo;s arcane skill. These items have a limited reserve of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points}&nbsp;and using them is a conscious decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Major Artifacts:</strong> These magical items come in two varieties&mdash;passive and active. Passive artifacts function continually regardless of the user&rsquo;s wishes. While they may require an action to use, such as donning a ring of invisibility, they do not require an arcane skill roll. Active items are artifacts which only function when required, such as a wand of fireballs. In these cases, an appropriate skill roll is required. Most wands, for example, require a Shooting roll. All relics, regardless of type, are considered \"always on\" because they require no Power Points. A cloak of invisibility conceals the wearer so long as it is worn, and a wand of fireballs can spew fiery death round after round.</li>\n<li><strong>True Relics: </strong>Relics are the most powerful magic items known. They are unique items, possessed of fabulous, often dangerous, power far in excess of those found in standard magical items. All true relics have a purpose. This may be as simple as destroying the races of giants or more complex, such as releasing an overlord, or bringing greater glory to the Dhakaani Empire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Items as Wild Cards</h3>\n<p>Magic items of any sort are considered Wild Cards, and so get a Wild Die when activating.</p>\n<p>If a non-Wild card picks up a magic item, he does get a Wild Die. This applies to Artificer Items as well &mdash; an Extra swinging a lowly +1 damage dagger receives a Wild Die to his Fighting roll.</p>\n<p>Magic items have wounds like Wild Card characters, so an enchanted sword is tougher than an ordinary weapon.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"56eTVwWzg79AhPF5"}

Look through the player&rsquo;s section of your setting or talk to the GM if it&rsquo;s a world of her own creation to see what kind of character catches your interest.</p>\n<h2>Race</h2>\n<p>Settings may feature everything from humans to strange aliens, graceful elves, or other exotic races. You can choose to play any race available in your particular setting.</p>\n<p>A number of sample races are detailed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{here}, as well as rules for players and Game Masters to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{create your own}.</p>\n<h2>HINDRANCES</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character&rsquo;s backstory.</p>\n<p>You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 points. (You can take more Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p>\n<p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also gives you additional points you can use to start with additional attribute or skill points, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}, or even money for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{gear}.</p>\n<p><strong>For 2 points you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li>\n<li>Choose an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edge}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For 1 point you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain another skill point, or</li>\n<li>Gain additional starting funds equal to twice your setting's starting amount (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TRAITS</h2>\n<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called &ldquo;@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{traits},&rdquo; and both work in exactly the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{here}).</p>\n<p>You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You&rsquo;re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12 unless a racial ability says otherwise (such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{Attribute Increase}). If it does, each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12+2.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg10_red.webp\" alt=\"An image of Red and quote 'No matter what setting she's playing, Emily's character is always 'Red'.

The Shooting skill, for example, covers all types of guns, bows, rocket launchers, and other ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{list}:<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are &ldquo;innate&rdquo; abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial ability}, Edge, or Hindrance says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it&rsquo;s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Maximums:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character&rsquo;s race starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Celestials and Guardians]{Celestials}</strong> start with a d6 in Faith, for example, which means their Faith skill may be increased to d12+1.</p>\n<h3>DERIVED STATISTICS</h3>\n<p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Movement} is explained in more detail here.</p>\n<p><strong>Parry</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn&rsquo;t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Target Number} (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>: A hero&rsquo;s default @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial abilities}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than &minus;1 or more than +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero&rsquo;s damage thres&shy;hold. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage]{Damage} rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm.</p>\n<p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero&rsquo;s Vigor, plus @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor Notes]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.</p>\n<h2>EDGES</h2>\n<p>Traits @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Attributes and skills} are a character&rsquo;s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}. Even two legionaries in <a title=\"Weird Wars Rome\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/store/weird-wars-rome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Weird Wars Rome</em></a> with identical Traits play vastly different depending on the Edges they take. One might focus on Leadership Edges that lets him rally his fellow soldiers while another concentrates on taking out large numbers of foes at once with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Sweep]{Sweep} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy}.</p>\n<p>Characters get @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges} by taking @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial abilities} (such as <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Humans]{Humans' Adpatability})</strong>, or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Advances}</strong> once play begins.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive list of Edges is available. Your setting book likely has additional abilities specific to that world or genre as well.</p>\n<h2>GEAR</h2>\n<p>Some settings provide your hero with all the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{gear} she needs. Most simply grant a starting amount of funds you can use to purchase whatever you like from a relevant list of weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.</p>\n<p>Unless your setting book or GM says otherwise, the standard starting amount is $500. A list of common gear and weapons can be found in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{Chapter Two}.</p>\n<p>Depending on the setting, this might be everything the character owns or it may represent their &ldquo;adventuring&rdquo; gear, with their more mundane belongings stored at a home or apartment. The latter is up to the Game Master. In modern settings, most everyone should have a home, clothes, appliances, and so on. The equipment you list on your character sheet should be your character&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventuring gear&rdquo; rather than an exhaustive list of everything she owns.</p>\n<p>Players don&rsquo;t have to worry about how much they can carry in most games, but if it becomes important, see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{Encumbrance}.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg11_roman.webp\" alt=\"An image of a Roman Centurion with quote 'Roman Centurion...These guys mean business!'\" />\n<h2>BACKGROUND EDGES</h2>\n<p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you care to. Ask yourself why she&rsquo;s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game?</p>\n<p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p>\n<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you&rsquo;ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you&rsquo;re playing what you want to play. There&rsquo;s no point in being the party&rsquo;s healer if that&rsquo;s not a role you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"5eu3eRvDg774sxwV"}

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>\n<h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Warforged Personality</h3>\n<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose&mdash;such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land&mdash;and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>\n<p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Built for War:</strong> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war. Negotiations were not part of their training, and their world knowledge off of the battlefield is limited.

Warforged are unable to wear additional @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]{armor}.</li>\n<li><strong>Living Construct:</strong> Warforged are living constructs made from organic and inorganic matter and are capable of emotions and conscious thought. They do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Poison]{poison} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Disease]{disease}. Wounds must be mended via the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair}</em> power or the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair} skill.

Most non-warforged strongly dislike the sight of warforged as they stand as living reminders of the horror that was the Last War. As such, warforged have -2 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} rolls when interacting with non-warforged and are often treated with less rights that others.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Design:</strong> Warforged are typically designed for specific purposes.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can&rsquo;t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onator]{Onatar&rsquo;s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can&rsquo;t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you&rsquo;re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can&rsquo;t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn&rsquo;t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist&mdash;if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who&rsquo;s spent decades studying texts doesn&rsquo;t? People of faith usually respond that it&rsquo;s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that&rsquo;s true, or maybe it&rsquo;s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: &ldquo;@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!&rdquo; Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn&rsquo;t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs of Khorvaire</h3>\n<p>With the rise ofthe dragonmarked House Tharashk, ores and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-ores. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a \"simpleton from the swamps.\"</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Heritage: </strong>Half-orcs may retain the strength of their orc parent or the adaptability of their human ancestry.

The dragonmark grants the ability to use dragonmark focus items and a power granted by that specific mark.</p>\n<p>Each time the adventurer selects the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.New Powers] Edge for this Arcane Background, the dragonmark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p>\n<h3>Dragonmarks and Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent.</strong> You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Scion. </strong>You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadows}, sailor for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storms}, soldier for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Dennieth]{Mark of Sentinel}, sage for the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Excoriate. </strong>When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?</li>\n<li><strong>Foundling. </strong>Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dragonmark Appearance</h3>\n<p>A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection}&nbsp;across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly.</p>\n<p>The character can also roll on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Dragonmark Quirks] table for their dragonmark.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarked heirs just need to concentrate to activate the powers of their dragonmark. They do not need their hands free or speak.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>All dragonmark powers, come from the dragonmark themselves and therefore tend to be subtle. Trappings would generally be the dragonmark growing warm to the touch and producing a soft glow. Other types of trappings can be created that should follow along these lines.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Dragonmark

Races","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Half-giant</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Coming from either Sarlona or Xen&rsquo;drik, they are now a true-breeding stock from the ancient Titans of Xen&rsquo;drik. Half-giants, for the most part, retain human sensibilities. They are curious, interested in cooperation and communication, and have a general tendency toward kindness. (Half-Giants are from Sarlona and Xen&rsquo;drik, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of Sarlona are descendants of ancient giant explorers from Xen'drik. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the Xen'drik titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p>\n<p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p>\n<h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3>\n<p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over Sarlona, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"&mdash;a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In Adar, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Cumbersome: </strong>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures. They suffer a &ndash;1 penalty to all @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Agility} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Fire Acclimated:</strong> Half-giants are accustomed to enduring high temperatures. They gain a +4 bonus to resist the effects of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Heat]{heat} and fire. Damage from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Heat]{heat} and fire is also reduced by 4.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Brute:</strong> Half-giants have natural core strength and fitness over coordination and flexibility. They treat @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} as linked to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Agility} for purposes of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Advancement}. The character may also resist Athletics @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Tests} with Strength if she chooses. Finally, half-giants increase the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Short Range} of any thrown item by +1. Double that for the adjusted @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Medium Range}, and double again for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Long Range}. If a thrown item&rsquo;s Range is 3/6/12, for example, a half-giant's @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is 4/8/16.</li>\n<li><strong>@Item[IsbekHb4py8znJkY]{Outsider (Minor)}:</strong> Most other races are put off by half-giants due to their abnormally large size. In fact, many are at first taken for young (if strangely well-groomed) hill giants. They have -2 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} as other races tend to distrust them.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} +1:</strong> Half-giants are much larger than humans, standing about 6 &frac12; &minus; 8 feet tall, increasing thier @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1. This increases their maximum @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Stomp:</strong> With a forceful stomp of their foot, half-giants can create a wave of trembling earth. With a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll, targets caught within a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Blast Templates]{Cone Template} originating from the half-giant&rsquo;s step are knocked @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Prone]{Prone}; with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they are also @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/races/half-giant.webp\" alt=\"Half-giant smith showing off his work.\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/half-giant.webp","_id":"FnZcvTkjtICeTXZf"}

Races","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Shifter</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h3>The Beast Within</h3>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h3>Similiar and Diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Yet to Come</h3>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Keen Senses: </strong>Shifters have heighted senses. They begin with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice} skill. This increases their maximum @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice} to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision: </strong>Shifters have the sight of their beastial ancestors who have hunted in the night andtheir eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Illumination]{Dim or Dark illumination} (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Shifting (Minor Shape Change): </strong>This ability allows a shifter to tap into his lycanthropic heritage. At character creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting is a free action and lasts 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{wound penalty}. When the shifting ends, the shifter must wait 4 hours before shifting again or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} when the second shifting ends. This level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from shifting. If the shifter uses this ability again during the recovery time, it inflicts another level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} that requires an additional 4 hours of recovery time.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide:</strong> The skin of beasthide shifters harden, providing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]{Armor} +4.</li>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk: </strong>The limbs, hands, and feet of cliffwalk shifters become stronger, allowing cliffwalk shifters to add +2 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} (climbing) rolls, and climb at their full @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace}.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight:</strong> Dreamsight shifters' instincts and awareness become heightened, granting them the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Beast Friend]{beast friend}</em> power. The power affects animals of Size +1 or smaller as well as swarms of Small size. Its effects only last while shifting rather than the power's normal duration.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute: </strong>Gorebrute shifters manifest powerful horns that can inflict @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d6 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons} in Savage Worlds Adventure Edition core rules).</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth: </strong>The face of a longtooth shifter distorts, growing a canine muzzle full of sharp teeth that cause @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Longtooth are also particularly fierce and agressive. They start with a d4 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw: </strong>The claws on the hands of razorclaw shifters grow and can be used to make attacks dealing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Razorclaw shifters respect little other than physical power. They get a +1 bonus to all @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride:&nbsp;</strong>The legs of swiftstride shifters elongate and they balance on the balls of their feet. Their base @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} increases by 2 and their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{running die} increases a die type.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing: </strong>The arms of swiftwing shifters grow leather flaps of skin similar to a bat's wings, granting the ability to fly at a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} of 6 per round, and \"run\" for extra movement as usual. Maneuvering uses the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill. These wings can be targeted, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Entangled} by foes.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive: </strong>Truedive shifters grow fins and webs of skin between their toes and fingers. They become aquatic creatures that cannot drown in water, can move their full @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} when @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{swimming}.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt: </strong>Wildhunt shifters' sense of smell becomes more sensitive, providing a +1 bonus to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide: </strong>A winterhide shifter gains a +8 bonus to resist the negative effects of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cold]{cold} environment. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cold]{Cold} damage is also reduced by 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/art/races/shifter.webp\" alt=\"Fierce Shifter warrior\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/shifter.webp","_id":"IQcsMa3gs9uyzU1Q"}

However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>PLAYING A VILLAIN</h3>\n<p>Not every player is going to want to play a hero, and that's fine. After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p>\n<p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory&mdash;villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p>\n<p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend&mdash;it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Rassilon.</p>\n<p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Rassilon and the more benefits he gains.</p>\n<p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p>\n<h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3>\n<p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory.</p>\n<h2>Gaining Glory</h2>\n<p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p>\n<p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p>\n<h3>VARIABLE GLORIOUS DEEDS</h3>\n<p>After each adventure, and only when the heroes return to civilization, one of the party may begin telling the tale of their epic battles and heroic deeds. The character makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll, modified as below.</p>\n<p>The DM is always free to add positive modifiers for truly heroic actions or based on the character's weaknesses and how he overcame them. Always try to think of how the heroes' true exploits (as opposed to any extra bits they invent) sound as a tale told by skalds. This is important, as it is the listeners on Khorvaire who are effectively granting them Glory.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an extra +1 or +2 should be the maximum. For instance, slaying a dread liche is certainly worthy of praise, but that is already covered in the table. However, lopping off his head with a Called Shot as the killing blow is worth a small modifier, as it's the sort of detail found in epic poems.</p>\n<p>Likewise, a Novice party with a d6 as their highest combat skill (including arcane skills) who slay a bunch of orc warriors in melee without any assistance should be rewarded with a greater chance of fame.</p>\n<p>The DM may also opt to add penalties to reflect weaker opponents (such as unarmed or unarmored orcs) or favorable character circumstances (every hero had a dozen alchemical <em>blast</em> devices on hand).</p>\n<h3>GLORY AWARDS</h3>\n<p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p>\n<p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack&ndash;damage\" routine.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p>\n<p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a &ndash;3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p>\n<h2>Additional Glory Information</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Calculating Glory]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"KeCw57crYz1tQ6Zw"}

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p>\n<h3>Bound to Spirits</h3>\n<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p>\n<h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3>\n<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dual Mind: </strong>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

Races","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Gnome</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to Zilargo: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Scribing</em> appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Gnome Cunning:&nbsp;</strong>Gnomes are intelligent creatures.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked orcs work extensively with humans and half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy&mdash;the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys&mdash;and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell&mdash;like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items&mdash;help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using Smarts is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation&mdash;harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you&rsquo;re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you&rsquo;re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they&rsquo;re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Schools</h3>\n<p>A wizard's intense studies lead him down two paths&mdash;a \"universalist\" who dabbles in all the various \"schools\" of magic, or a \"specialist\" who focuses on a school at the expense of other studies.</p>\n<p>Specialists designate one favored school and two opposition schools from the list below.

As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of Sarlona. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p>\n<h3>Free People</h3>\n<p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p>\n<p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of Sarlona and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3>\n<p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of Sarlona's native humans and giant explorers from Xen'drik. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of Xen'drik flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of Xen'drik. Riedrans and less trusting Syrk humans claim the cult of Karrak is a convenient front for the practice of dark magic.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Eneko are natural strong.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h3>Khorvar</h3>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>Mark of Detection </em>is found in House Medani and the <em>Mark of Storm </em>in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.</p>\n<p>With the <em>Mark of Storm</em>, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the <em>Mark of Detection</em> to offer services of personal protection.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Heritage:</strong> Half-elves may retain the grace of their elven parent or the adaptability of their human ancestry.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Talenta Halflings</h3>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur&mdash;like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks&mdash;centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p>\n<p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and HouseJorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Halfling's average only about four feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Language]{Language}: </strong>Halflings start with a d8 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Languages]{Halfling}.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Pace:</strong> Halflings have short legs compared to human-sized races.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Among the&nbsp;<em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as&nbsp;<em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p>\n<h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

Spellcasters specialize in certain forms of that technology, while artificers tinker with its fundamental workings. Artificers understand magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing facility with magic items and constructs, and in many ways, they keep the magical world of Eberron running.</p>\n<p>Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.</p>\n<h3>ARCANE SCIENCE</h3>\n<p>In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.</p>\n<p>During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations.</p>\n<h3>SEEKERS OF NEW LORE</h3>\n<p>Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.</p>\n<p>This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Artificers craft, invent, and tinker with their inventions. All your powers are produced by inventions that are crafted using various tools. When creating an artificer, pick at least one kind of tool set that the artificer works with; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies} for potions and ungents, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools} for general tinkering, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Warforged Repair Kit]{warforged repair kit} if they work strictly with warforged, or another artisan tool kit that makes sense.</p>\n<p>In general, it's assumed an artificer is constantly working and tinker on their inventions during downtime. Perhaps before bed, in the morning, or during meals. It should be assumed the inventor takes at least an hour a day preparing items that might be used. If the artificer can't perform this tinkering, or does not have their tools, she can't use her powers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Burst]{burst}</em> with a poison effect, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.</p>\n<p>Artificers take pride in their custom inventions, often giving them creative names to differentiate them from other artificers. Such as \"Elenna's Miraculous Healing Ungent\" or \"Mending Spider\". You should make sure to do the same for your powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"WkAQaYluuHPWNKAx"}

Many Vassals see her as no less vital to civilization than @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aureon]{Aureon} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Boldrei]{Boldrei}, and they believe that when the mortal races accept this truth, the world will become much brighter. Dol Arrah is the deity of honorable combat, self-sacrifice, and sunlight, manifests as a peacemaker, a careful planner, and a strategist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dol Arrah is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good. She is the patron of paladins, diplomats, all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons.&nbsp; To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Arawai} by lighting her way during the growing season.</p>\n<p>In addition, in her role as a sun god, she brings light to pierce the darkest places of the world. She is commonly represented as a human or half-elf knight shining with holy radiance, and sometimes as a red dragon perched on a cloud. She is said to be the sister of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Dol Dorn} and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Mockery}.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Honor, sacrifice, light, the sun, diplomacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> A rising sun, a red dragon, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.</li>\n<li><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Halberd</li>\n<li><strong>Priest Training:</strong> Dol Arrah&rsquo;s priests must have the highest integrity.

However, this magic system is not the same as in the Savage Worlds core rules, having been heavily modified to fit the style of magic present the <cite>Eberron Campaign Setting</cite>.</p>\n<p>A brief summary of the major changes is listed below.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li>No Power Points are used. Instead, spells suffer a Casting Modifier, which can be \"worked off\" by taking longer to cast the spell. While mages can therefore cast more frequently, magic can be slower to invoke.</li>\n<li>There are multiple Arcane Backgrounds that have been added and the core Arcane Backgrounds have been modified. Use the rules provided as part as this system for each background.</li>\n<li>There are different effects for Dynamic Backlash for each type of magic. This replaces the one size fits all optional Dynamic Backlash rule for magical backlash.</li>\n<li>New spells have been added, specifically ones that are used in the <cite>Eberron Campaign Setting</cite>. It is recommended that you take a look at these.</li>\n<li>Some spells have been modified from the core rules. Use these versions instead.</li>\n<li>Spells have a much longer Duration than in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> core rules, but cannot be maintained beyond the base Duration.</li>\n<li>Rules for ritual magic are included to allow creation of powerful spells at the cost of time and coin.</li>\n</ul>\n</aside>\n<p>The following setting rules apply to&nbsp;<em>all</em> forms of Arcane Backgrounds in the <cite> Savage Eberron</cite> setting. Unless a change is noted below, the normal rules apply.</p>\n<h3>Using Magic</h3>\n<p>As an action, a hero activates a power by picking a target within Range and making an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} roll minus the Casting Modifier.</p>\n<p>Success means the power activates as usual. A raise grants any additional bonuses stated in its description.</p>\n<p>Failure means the caster is @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken} and the power does not activate. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} when activating a power is called Backlash. The player immediately rolls on the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Dynamic Backlash] table (or the Backlash table appropiate for their Arcane Background) and all currently active powers instantly terminate.</p>\n<p>Some of the Casting Modifiers are very high, making it seem all but very difficult to succeed for powerful magic. Magic is wide and far reaching in the world of Eberron, but powerful magic is very rare and only a few individuals know how to master such complex magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Preparation:</strong> Each round a mage spends (after the first) preparing his spell reduces the Casting Modifier penalty by 1, to a minimum of zero. The caster may take no other actions during the round, including movement, though he retains his usual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Parry] score if attacked. Once the caster finishes preparing, he must cast his spell on the following round or the magic is wasted and he must begin again.</p>\n<p>Other penalties to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} rolls aren't Casting Modifiers and cannot be reduced by spending extra time in preparation.</p>\n<p><strong>Canceling Spells:</strong> Casters can cancel their spells before the Duration expires. This is a free action and <em>immediately</em> cancels the effects of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining Spells:</strong> Characters can maintain those spells that allow it as long as desired, but each one maintained inflicts a &minus;1 to all further @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} rolls.</p>\n<h3>Components</h3>\n<p>Manipulating magic in Eberron requires components to work properly. A wizard begins the game with 10 components. Each casting uses one set of ingredients per @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Rank} of the spell. Additional components cost 1 galifar (gp) each.</p>\n<p>A wizard who doesn't have sufficient components to cast a particular spell suffers a &minus;1 penalty to his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} roll per missing component. Thus, if a mage wants to cast a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Veteran} spell (requiring 3 components) but only has a single component, he suffers a &minus;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This is fixed and cannot be offset by spending additional time in preparation. Components are expended in the casting whether the roll is successful or not. Components are different based on arcane background, consult the background for some general ideas of what those might include.</p>\n<p><strong>Rare Components:</strong> By using more expensive, unique, and rare components the Casting Modifier can be reduced. The caster must replace all the necessary components to gain the benefit and as usual, the components are used up regardless of the ritual&rsquo;s outcome. At a cost of 25 galifars (gp) for each component, the caster ignores a &minus;1 penalty or for 100 galifars (gp) per component, he ignores a &minus;2 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Disruption</h3>\n<p>Disruption can happen one of two ways.</p>\n<p><strong>During Casting Preparation:</strong> A mage must maintain concentration while casting. If he takes any damage during this time, the magic may be disrupted. To maintain concentration, the caster must succeed on an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill}. The roll is made after any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Soak Rolls]{Soak rolls} If he wins, he may continue casting. If he fails, his casting is ruined, components spent, and he must begin again.</p>\n<p>A caster who is Shaken by non-damaging means, such as a Test of Wills, must make a simple @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} to maintain concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Spells: </strong>A caster who has an active spell in play (one with a Duration listed as a time increment) may be disrupted if he takes damage. This works as above, except if the mage fails his roll all of his active spells are dropped after the attack that caused the disruption. With success, he keeps all his active spells functioning.</p>\n<p>A caster with active spells who is injured while casting another spell makes just a single roll. On a failure, he loses all his active spells and must start his current casting from scratch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Articles on the Use of Magic</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic]{Using Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Power Modifiers]{Powers Modifiers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers Summary list}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rituals]{Rituals}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"aJroj0nks5dMw2qn"}

These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p>\n<p>The GM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p>\n<h3>First Card</h3>\n<p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated. Use the suit entry of the second card on the Trap Type table below to determine the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} die for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Detecting: </strong>Detecting a trap requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll. Unless a character has @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{running} hero rolls at &ndash;2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists. The hero may halt his movement if he spots a trap (advisable if it's right in front of him).</p>\n<p><strong>Disarming: </strong>Disarming a detected trap requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Thievery] roll and takes a complete round (no other actions possible, including movement).

He suffers 2d8 damage (determined by the Diamonds).</p>\n<p>Note that although the trap scored a raise over Aelric's Agility total, this was not an attack roll and so it does not deal +1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>Aelric suffers 11 damage, enough to cause him a wound.

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for providing taxes and military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. It was acknowledged that all power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. Throughout Galifar, the nobility remained the foundation of the united kingdom. Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service. Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the nobles didn&rsquo;t administer justice, but it was their duty to maintain the system, appointing justices and maintaining the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and as life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners&mdash;initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, it remained the case that the majority of property was associated with a noble&rsquo;s domain, and that it was the local lord who appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to the count, the count to their duke, the duke to the prince, the prince to the king.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Common Knowledge, Intimidation, Persuasion, Traditions</p>\n<p><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Aristocract, Charismatic, House Scion, Rich, Filthy Rich</p>\n<p><strong>Social Edges:</strong> Connections</p>","_id":"gxECvxnAkP6qlajl"}

Races","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Elf</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Tens of thousands ofyears ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p>\n<p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-races.aVHntifcJ9GmX4Y1]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.125em;\">Elves of the Five Nations</span></h3>\n<p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p>\n<p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p>\n<p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p>\n<h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Shadow</em> first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>Mark of Shadow </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings.</p>\n<h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3>\n<p>For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p>\n<p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan&mdash;live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Elves are graceful and agile.

From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire ofAerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans&mdash;or perhaps because of them&mdash;humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.</p>\n<p>Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue.

a Druid</h2>\n<p>Druids draw primal magic from the world itself. The process isn&rsquo;t like the spells of a wizard or the tools of an artificer, nor is it a divine petition to a higher power. Well, not exactly. Legend recounts how the great progenitor dragon Eberron enveloped the jealous evil of Khyber in the living prison that would become the world. If arcane magic comes from the tears of Siberys above, then Druidic magic is the blood and breath of Eberron herself, granting power to those who seek to defend her and the natural order from the threats beyond.</p>\n<p>Most druids are swathed in tradition, usually initiated by a sect that teaches the secrets of this primal magic while also charging the aspirant with specific duties. While some sects are loosely aligned, each one has its own ideas as to the role their kind should play in the world.</p>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature&rsquo;s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Civilization</h3>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature&rsquo;s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<p>You can roll on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Druidic Beliefs] table to see how your druid views civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Sovereign Host</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the Sovereign Host is a civilized faith with shrines in the great cities of the Five Nations but a number of shrines to deities tied to nature can be found in the wilds. Balinor is the Sovereign of the Hunt, Arawai brings nature&rsquo;s bounty, and the Devourer embodies its destructive power and the hunger that reclaims its waste. In Eberron, a priest of Balinor isn&rsquo;t inherently required to follow one trail or the other, but the main differences between the two lay in how command of nature is granted, and the purpose for which they use it. While it&rsquo;s common for the two paths to recognize one another, such respect isn&rsquo;t always equal.</p>\n<p>From a philosophical perspective, a druid is an envoy of nature with a connection to the environment itself, not a servant of a higher power. By contrast, the cleric serves a higher power and holds dominion over the natural world. While druids shun such metal armaments, nature clerics usually practice combat in manmade heavy metal armors until proficient. Yet, clerics lack the primal understanding required to communicate in Druidic and to assume Wild Shape, which is a reflection of the druid&rsquo;s deep connection to the natural world.</p>\n<p>Such differences lead to a deep disconnect between the typical druid and a nature worshiping cleric. The Warden of the Wood might see the priests of Balinor as an arrogant outsider, a city-dweller who believes that humanoids hold some sort of divine right over the planet, which is admittedly often the case. To the priestess of Arawai, nature is something that serves the people and her primary concern is ensuring a bountiful harvest, not driving farmers from their fields.</p>\n<p>While this is the obvious contrast, it&rsquo;s possible to create a character who uses one class while following the opposite path. Perhaps you want to play a priest of Balinor but you love the idea of hunting in the form of a wolf, or you want to be Ashbound but have no interest in ever assuming a Wild Shape. While there will be the occasional disconnect, like the Ashbound cleric can&rsquo;t use Wild Shape, the Balinor druid can&rsquo;t turn undead, look to juxtapose these ideas to best match the story and experience you&rsquo;re looking for, using backgrounds like the acolyte or outlander to cultivate the option.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Regardless of how they view civilization, druids are more powerful in the wilds, but have more difficultly controling the elemental energies within more civilized locations. Druids must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Druid Casting Modifiers</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Casting Modifier</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Enviroment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>In the wild or natural caverns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>Rural (farm, worked cavern, mine)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&minus;1</td>\n<td>Urban (town or city, artificial structures)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Druids interact constantly with nature, drawing all their power from it. They regularly perform various rituals while they rest or pray. They regularly tend to the natural order of things. This opens their conduits of power to the natural energies and allows them to activate powers later without begining the appeal in the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Druidic powers are cast through chants, talismans, and talking with nature itself. Depending on the spell, the druid may cast bones, sprinkle of ash, rubbing a talisman, beseeching the forces of nature. Trappings for the spells of druids should all include natural components or aspects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"q3hdsgwk5MnF9Eby"}

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p>\n<h3>The Marguul</h3>\n<p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p>\n<p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</strong>&nbsp;Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>A Hidden People</h3>\n<p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p>\n<p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p>\n<p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p>\n<h3>Masks and Personas</h3>\n<p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>\n<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</strong> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em>&nbsp;power except it cannot affect clothing or gear. The power has no limit on duration. When they die they return to their natural form.</li>\n<li><strong>@Item[IDTn27I04lhlelWo]{Changeling Instinct}:</strong> Changelings are socially and psychologically intuitive due to their adoption and understanding of different personas.

Races","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Dwarf</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Warding </em>appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dwarven Resilience:</strong> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

To perform a ritual the magician must first know the power or have access to a tome providing the instructions to the ritual. In addition, it is wise to have a location where he can work without disruption.</p>\n<p>Activating a power via ritual is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task} using the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill}&nbsp; and the caster needs to accumulate five successes/raises within five rounds. The last roll, the one achieving the fifth success, determines the spell&rsquo;s effect. If opposed, the final roll is the only one the target(s) roll against.</p>\n<p>For powers known to the caster, the time for each \"action\" (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]) is one minute per final Casting Modifier of the spell, including any power modifiers (see below). Abilities which reduce the Casting Modifier, such as Edges or special abilities of an Arcane Background, do not apply unless specifically stated to affect rituals. The Casting Modifier does not apply to the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} roll unless the magician chooses to perform the ritual faster. A caster can reduce the time per action by one minute for each &minus;1 Casting Modifier applied to all @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} rolls to a minimum of one minute per action.</p>\n<h3>Components</h3>\n<p>A wizard requires one component per Rank of the power being cast. Should he not have enough, he suffers a &minus;1 penalty to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} (not a Casting Modifier) per component he is short. Ritual components must be of higher quality and cost ten galifars (gp) each.</p>\n<h3>Disruption</h3>\n<p>Rituals may be disrupted as any power, and the primary caster may end an active ritual as a free action.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>Powers with a Range greater than Touch double their Range automatically when cast via ritual. Powers with a Range of Touch or Self gain a Range of Smarts.</p>\n<h3>Power Modifiers</h3>\n<p>The caster can choose additional benefits by increasing the Casting Modifier from the available @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Power Modifiers]{power modifiers} for magic. However a few of the modifiers have different Casting Modifiers or benefits when applied to a ritual casting.</p>\n<h3>Preparation and Assistance</h3>\n<p>Using additional casters or sacrificing resources make rituals easier to complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Casters:</strong> Assistants with the same Arcane Background may aid the caster by making @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{support} rolls at each step using their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} as long as they possess the power. If they do not possess the power, they may still assist but suffer a &minus;2 penalty to their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} roll. If a Casting Modifier is applied, assistants suffer the same penalty to their skill roll as the lead caster.</p>\n<p><strong>Rare Components:</strong> By using more expensive, unique, and rare components the Casting Modifier can be reduced. The caster must replace all the necessary components to gain the benefit and as usual, the components are used up regardless of the ritual&rsquo;s outcome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At a cost of 50 galifars (gp) for each component, the caster ignores a &minus;1 penalty.</li>\n<li>At a cost of 150 galifars (gp) for each component, the caster ignores a &minus;2 penalty.</li>\n<li>At a cost of 500 galifars (gp) for each component, the caster ignores a &minus;4 penalty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Failure</h3>\n<p>Failing a ritual incurs normal Backlash to the caster and any participants for their Arcane Background. If the failure occurs on a Complication (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dramatic Tasks]), the caster and participants suffer 2d6 damage, ignoring armor.</p>\n<h3>Unknown Rituals</h3>\n<p>A wizard may also perform rituals for powers he does not know, provided he has detailed instructions, sometimes found on scrolls or in ancient tomes. The ritual power must be on the caster's allowed list, though it may be of a higher Rank.</p>\n<p>The magician must first figure out how to perform the ritual by making an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana] roll. He suffers a &minus;2 penalty per Rank of the power past Novice to the roll (&minus;2 for Seasoned, &minus;4 for Veteran, and so on) and may only attempt the roll once per day. On a critical failure, he can't attempt to decipher the ritual again until he gains an Advance. Performing a ritual for an unknown power otherwise works the same, but Casting Modifiers are doubled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Articles on the Use of Magic</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic]{Using Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Power Modifiers]{Powers Modifiers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers Summary list}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rituals]{Rituals}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"ypyzDxOrWPcG0PFo"}
