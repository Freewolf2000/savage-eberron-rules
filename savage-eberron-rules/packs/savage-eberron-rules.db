{"_id":"0WpWL1WImduaM9eQ","name":"Chases and Vehicles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Chases &amp; Vehicles</h1>\n<p>One of the most thrilling staples of adventure film, television, and fiction is the chase. This simple twist on the regular combat rules lets you race muscle cars over blasted deserts, track freestyle runners across concrete jungles, and even recreate desperate dogfights in the sky or the depths of space.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Quick Encounters]{Quick Encounters} rules if you just want to find out if the heroes catch a fleeing foe. If you want more detail, use these rules for highly mobile pursuits too large for the tabletop. You’ll also find rules for resolving damage against vehicles, and what effect it has on their drivers in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Participants vie for position using “Chase Cards” to track relative distance</p>\n<h3>Maneuvering Skills</h3>\n<p>The following rules often call for maneuvering skill rolls. Exactly what skill that is depends on whether the character is on foot, mounted, or in a vehicle of some sort:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Airplane or Spaceship: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting}</li>\n<li><strong>Foot or Bike: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</li>\n<li><strong>Mount or Wagon: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding}</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Driving]{Driving}</li>\n<li><strong>Watercraft: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>The standard results for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critically Failing} a maneuvering roll are listed below, but the GM can always create her own result appropriate to the situation as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Mounted Combat]{Mounted}: </strong>Roll a d6. 1–2: the rider loses his turn; 3–4: his mount suffers @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} (this applies to the animal’s rolls <em>and</em> the rider’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding} rolls); 5–6: the rider suffers Fatigue from a bad bounce, low-hanging obstacle, or overexertion trying to control his animal.</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle: </strong>The operator must roll on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong> table.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking/Running:</strong> Roll a die. Even, he loses the rest of his turn as he stumbles, negotiates an obstacle, or takes a wrong turn. Odd, he suffers @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/FootChase.webp\" />\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>To start a chase, shuffle an extra deck of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} and deal them out in a row on the table (nine is a good number for most chases, add more as needed).</p>\n<p>Now break all the participants into each group that will move and act independently. Everyone in the same ship, boat, or vehicle, for example, is one group. In a foot chase, each player character acts independently because they move independently. The horde of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} chasing them can be broken up into groups as the GM decides.</p>\n<p>The rear-most character or vehicle should be at the rear—on the far left card or “Card 1.” Everyone else should be placed to his right as fits the circumstances. Add more cards to either end of the row if someone falls behind or surges ahead.</p>\n<p>The Range is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker’s card) times the Range Increment, which varies for the type of chase:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Range Increments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\" style=\"text-align:left\">Type</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading centered\">Increment</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foot, Mounted, or Vehicular</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Airplane or Sailing Ship</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jets or Starships</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These are <em>suggested</em> ranges based on the weapons typically used in that type of chase. The goal is to give most ranged weapons the ability to fire at a few cards distance and give an advantage to those with longer ranged weapons. Increase or decrease the Range Increment as makes sense for the particular scenario. In a tank battle, for instance, you might want to change the Range Increment to 100, even though it’s a “vehicular” fight.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/ChaseExample.webp\" />\n<h2>Chase Rounds</h2>\n<p>Once all the participants are placed, deal each independent character or group an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card} at the start of each round as usual. They then act in whatever order they choose as their Action Card comes up. This is important so passengers can @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support} their driver before he has to make a critical roll, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test} a foe to make him @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Distracted and Vulnerable]{Vulnerable}, attack <em>before</em> their vehicle changes distance (<em>or</em> after) to take maximum advantage of their weapons, and so on.</p>\n<p>The participants can move along the track using the <strong>Change Position</strong> maneuver (see below), closing on foes, running from them, or attempting to reach some objective.</p>\n<p>The length of each round is up to the GM, but is usually a combat round in a foot or car chase. Battles in space might represent many minutes per round until the action zooms in on a fast-paced dogfight.</p>\n<p><strong>Boarders:</strong> Characters in or on an enemy vehicle get their own Action Card (as a group).</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Speed:</strong> The Game Master must decide who’s allowed to participate in a chase. A kid on a bike might be able to chase bandits in a car if the streets are very congested, but is left behind after a round on the open road.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending the Chase:</strong> A chase ends when one side gets away (disabling all pursuers, the Flee maneuver, etc.) or is forced to stop. Participants can always choose to stop if they want, either dropping out or stopping to engage their enemies.</p>\n<p>A chase might also end after a certain number of rounds or as one or more of those involved reach a certain card along the track. In a <cite>Weird War Two</cite> bombing run, for example, the bombers might need to reach the last card on the track to drop their payload. The fighters scrambling after them must try to stop them before they reach their target.</p>\n<h3>Chase Actions</h3>\n<p>Characters in a chase can do most anything they’d normally do, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support}, use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Powers]{powers}, or make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Attacks]{attacks}. The GM decides how close a character has to be to try a particular action. A defender must be able to see or hear a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Taunt]{Taunt} for it to be effective, for example. If the attacker and defender are connected via audio or video feeds, of course, distance probably won’t matter.</p>\n<p>Nonplayer character crews of ships, starships, and other large vehicles are assumed to be doing their jobs already and shouldn’t roll Support or Tests. Those special actions are the domain of the player characters or named Extras and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards}—including those on the opposing side!</p>\n<p><strong>Held Actions:</strong> A character on Hold may attempt to interrupt enemy actions as usual. In personal combat (including foot chases), the two make opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} rolls. When mounted, it’s opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding} rolls. In vehicle chases, the GM must decide which skills are most appropriate (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} vs. maneuvering to interrupt the driver, for example).</p>\n<p>If trying to act before an entire vehicle, ship, or group with multiple characters takes its action, the opposed roll should be made against the driver or leader.</p>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Groups</h2>\n<p>Make Group rolls for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} who move and act together. If they have a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} leader, use his skill to make maneuvering rolls and assume his leadership keeps the group together.</p>\n<p>This means @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken} members of a group are dragged along with the rest, and individual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} or other conditions are ignored unless that specific member is targeted, or all the members of the group share the same condition.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>Below are a number of special maneuvers characters can attempt during a chase. Maneuvers may also be part of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}. A driver can Change Position and fire his weapon, for example, or say he attempts a Force if he gets close enough.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Board (Action): </strong>Sailing ships use grappling hooks and planks to pull their prey close and board. Starships might use breaching tubes or assault pods.<br />To board, the attacker and defender must be on the same Chase Card. The two then make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker is successful, the two vessels are joined and his crew may board the enemy craft.<br />If defenders have been designated to repel boarders and weren’t being used for other purposes (such as sailing or crewing stations on a starship), they start on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hold]{Hold} unless the attacker won the boarding roll with a raise.<br />Once a boarding action begins, the com­mander of the boarded vessel can only attempt to Change Position, which is made at −4 if grappling lines, tractor beams, or other restraints are involved. If she’s successful, her vessel is no longer grappled (though some of the boarders may still be on her ship!). With a raise, she breaks free and may move one Chase Card in either direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Change Position (Action or Free Action):</strong> A character or driver may change his position by making a maneuvering roll as a free action. Success allows him to move up or down one Chase Card, and up to two with a raise. The character may also Change Position as an action, adding +2 to his roll. Either way, this maneuver may only be used once per turn.<br /><strong>Speed Bonus:</strong> If a rider, runner, ship, or vehicle’s Top Speed is faster than the fastest of his rivals, he adds +1 to his maneuvering roll to Change Position, or +2 if he’s twice as fast.<br /><strong>Dropping Back:</strong> In a linear chase, a character may drop “back” one or two Chase Cards without making a maneuvering roll. He may not Change Position further, either as an action or a free action.</li>\n<li><strong>Evade (Action or Free Action):</strong> The char­acter or driver zigzags through terrain, maximizes cover, or otherwise concentrates on not getting hit. Melee and ranged attacks against him, his vehicle, or anyone on it suffer a −2 penalty until the start of that vehicle’s next turn. The character and any occupants on his mount or in his vehicle also take the penalty to their attacks as the erratic movement or obstacles affect their targeting and aim as well. If the character performs this maneuver as an action, the penalty increases to −4 (in both directions).<br />Evade may not be taken more than once per round (it does not stack).</li>\n<li><strong>Flee (Action):</strong> A character or vehicle may escape the chase if there are at least four Chase Cards between himself and the closest foe. If so, he makes a maneuvering roll at −4 and escapes if successful. The penalty is reduced to −2 if there are at least five cards between them, and 0 if there are six or more.</li>\n<li><strong>Force (Action):</strong> The attacker attempts to force a rival away from his vehicle or into an obstacle. To do so, both must be on the same Chase Card and make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker wins, he <strong>Bumps</strong> (see below) his foe. A raise is treated as if the defender rolled a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuvering roll (see <strong>Maneuvering Skills</strong>, above).<br />The GM may also allow characters to use other skills, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, to put obstacles in the foe’s path. Critical Failure means the attempt backfires on the attacker!</li>\n<li><strong>Hold Steady (Free Action):</strong> The character, driver, or pilot holds steady to line up a better shot. They ignore the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Unstable Platform]{Unstable Platform} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Running} penalties, but attacks against the vehicle and all its occupants are made at +2 until the beginning of their next turn (this does not stack with Vulnerable).</li>\n<li><strong>Ram (Action):</strong> An attacker can Ram a defender if they’re on the same Chase Card by making opposed maneuvering rolls. If successful, both participants cause the following damage to the other: <br />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scale:</strong> The base damage each being or vehicle causes is based on its Scale: Small (d6), Normal (2d6), Large (3d6), Huge (4d6), and Gargantuan (5d6).</li>\n<li><strong>Raise:</strong> +d6 bonus damage for the attacker if he got a raise on his maneuvering roll. Toughness: +d6 if the vehicle’s Tough­ness is higher than his foe’s; +2d6 if Toughness is twice as high.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Speed]{Speed}:</strong> +d6 to both sides if the attacker’s Top Speed is between 60 and 120 MPH; +2d6 if it’s over 120 MPH.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"bump-aside\">\n<h2>Bump</h2>\n<p>Several circumstances result in a character or group being “Bumped.” The foe who caused the Bump may move the defender one Chase Card in any direction. She may do this at any time during her turn as she chooses (to resolve other attacks first, for example).</p>\n<p>When a target is Bumped by an indirect action (such as a Complication), the opposing side chooses the direction.</p>\n<p>An attacker can’t Bump a particular target more than one space each turn regardless of the source (multiple attacks, the Force maneuver, etc.). Other attackers, even those sharing the same @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card}, may Bump the target separately, however.</p>\n<p>Groups always stay together in a chase, so they’re only moved if their driver or leader is Bumped, or the GM feels it’s narratively appropriate.</p>\n<p>Bumps are only used in chases. Ignore them on the tabletop.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>If a character or group’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card} is a Club, something has gone wrong. An obstacle may block the path, the engine might stall, or a hero might have to run through mud, ice, uphill, or some other impediment.</p>\n<p>The character, driver, or pilot must make a maneuvering roll as a free action to deal with the Complication. The suit on his current Chase Card determines any modifier to the maneuvering roll and the results of failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Action Card</em> triggers the Comp­lication; the <em>Chase Card</em> defines any modifier (Mod) and the result of failure.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Complications</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Suit</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading centered\">mod</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Failure Result</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spades</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">—</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuver­ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hearts</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">—</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diamonds</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">-2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Clubs</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">-2</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuver­ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Joker</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped up to two Chase Cards.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Special Conditions:</strong> GMs can also use Complications to trigger special conditions or hazards of the encounter. For example, trig­gering reinforcements anytime a Diamond Complication occurs, or the first character to fail a Club Complication is hit by lightning during a battle in a fierce storm.</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Characters may make ranged and melee attacks normally, using all their usual @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} as usual as long as the GM agrees they make sense in the particular situation.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Melee Attacks:</strong> In foot, mounted, or car chases, characters can make hand-to-hand attacks only if they’re on the same Chase Card. The usual rules, such as the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Ganging Up]{Gang-Up} bonus, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Withdrawing From Melee]{Withdrawing From Melee}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Innocent Bystanders]{Innocent Bystanders}, etc., apply as the GM sees fit.<br />Should anyone want to attack a moving vehicle, its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Parry} is 2+ half the driver’s maneuvering skill, plus its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{Handling}. Attacks aren’t usually possible between very fast vehicles, airplanes, starships, and the like.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Drivers and chara­cters can fire ranged weapons as usual. The @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker’s card) times the Range Increment. Attacks may also target crew if they’re visible (don’t forget any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover} they might have).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Characters/Mounts:</strong> Damage is resolved normally, but if the character (or his mount) is @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Stunned]{Stunned}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounded} in a chase, he’s Bumped as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Vehicles cannot be Shaken, but if damage equals or exceeds their Toughness (whether they take a Wound or not), the driver must make a maneuvering roll or go <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong>.<br />Each raise on a vehicular damage roll causes a Wound and one roll on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Vehicle Critical Hits]{Vehicle Critical Hits}</strong> table (not one roll per Wound). Most vehicles can take three Wounds before they’re <strong>Wrecked</strong> (see below). Each Wound reduces a vehicle’s Handling by 1 (to a maximum of −4).<br />If this is a chase, damage that equals or exceeds a vehicle’s Toughness also <strong>Bumps</strong> it (see above), but only once per attacker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Called Shots on Vehicles:</strong> To target a par­ticular part of a vehicle, the GM assigns a modifier based on the dimensions of the target. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size &amp; Scale}</strong> and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover}</strong> for specifics. If the attack is successful and causes a Wound, it also causes the effects for that area (see the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Vehicle Critical Hits]{Vehicle Critical Hits}</strong> table).</p>\n<aside class=\"vehicle-attacks\">\n<h3>Fixed Weapons</h3>\n<p>Front-mounted weapons may only fire at targets ahead of them, side weapons to their respective sides, and rear weapons behind. Top or bottom mounted turreted weapons may fire in any direction unless the situation or particular vehicle says otherwise (assume ships, planes, or starships rise and fall during the turn to accommodate their top or bottom weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Side-Mounted Weapons (Cannons):</strong> Firing fixed side-mounted weapons—those that must be aimed by turning the entire vessel—must be positioned. The captain or pilot chooses his target and makes an opposed maneuvering roll as an action. Failure means he can’t line up a shot this turn. Success means the attacker may fire up to half his guns on one side at the target, and a raise means he may fire all of them at that target (a “broadside”).</p>\n<p>Treat each set of up to four cannons as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{\"linked\"}, rolling attacks and damage separately for each set.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossing the T:</strong> If a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Large} target (or greater) is hit by a broadside at @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Short Range}, it’s “raked” along its length. Add an additional d6 to each damage roll resulting from the rake.</p>\n<h3>Reaction Fire</h3>\n<p>Weapons with this quality spray massive amounts of matter or energy, making them quick to fire against enemies who dart in and out of range to attack. Once per round when their craft is attacked, Reaction Fire weapons may return fire at −2. The attack is resolved <em>after</em> the enemy’s who triggered it (if the gunner survives).</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Wrecked</h3>\n<p>Vehicles take three @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} before they’re “Wrecked” as their base. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Large} vehicles can take four Wounds, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Huge} can take five, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Gargantuans} can take six.</p>\n<p>A wrecked land vehicle can’t move, but its weapons may still be fired if they aren’t powered by the vehicle’s propulsion system.</p>\n<p>Watercraft sink. Small vessels sink in a few rounds. Medium boats might take up to an hour to slip beneath the surface, and large ships might take several hours.</p>\n<p>Aircraft plummet to the ground and are destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Occupants:</strong> Those inside a vehicle (and whatever it hits, if it matters) take damage depending on what caused the Wreck:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Collisions:</strong> If the vehicle is Wrecked from a Collision on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong> table, the passengers suffer Xd6 damage, where X is equal to the Wounds the vehicle suffered from the collision (don’t forget any <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{Air Bags &amp; Safety Harnesses}</strong>).</li>\n<li>Damage: If the vehicle is Wrecked from Wounds caused by enemy attacks, occu­pants in a land vehicle, speed boat, starship, or similar vessel take 3d6 damage, or 5d6 if the GM feels the vehicle was traveling at a high speed (usually in excess of 60 MPH) or some other precarious circumstance. Those on large boats or ships don’t take Wounds but must contend with Swimming rolls and survival afterward.<br />Occupants of an aircraft make an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll if they have parachutes to land safely. Failure means they take <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps &amp; Bruises}</strong>, from a hard landing. Those who roll a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} or are without parachutes plummet to their death, unless the GM feels they have a chance to survive. In that case they suffer <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Falling]{Falling}</strong> damage instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Repairs</h3>\n<p>Characters may repair vehicles given sufficient time and at least some basic tools. The attempt takes two hours per Wound and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair]{Repair} roll. If the roll fails, the mechanic must start over.</p>\n<p>Field work requires at least a toolbox and basic supplies, and subtracts 2 from the Repair roll. An average garage negates this penalty, and an excellent or dedicated facility adds +2.</p>\n<p>Each success and raise on the Repair roll fixes one of the vehicle’s Wounds. With an additional raise above and beyond what’s required to fix all Wounds, the repair time is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrecks: </strong>Wrecked vehicles can be repaired if the mechanic has access to a full body shop and spare parts (GM’s call). This takes a full day before other repairs can be made.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/Driveby.webp\" />\n<h2>Customized Chases</h2>\n<p>A little customization can make each chase different and unique. Here are some ideas you can use for your encounters.</p>\n<h3>City Streets</h3>\n<p>Busy streets are a dangerous place for high-speed vehicle or frantic foot chases. Ranged attacks are made at −2 (in addition to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} penalties) to account for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover} of buildings, cars, pedestrians, and so on.</p>\n<p>Complications besides Jokers have a mini­mum penalty of −2 to represent the dangers of running red lights, pedestrians that must be avoided, blocked streets, or other hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Rooftops:</strong> If the chase takes place on rooftops, change the results for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failures} (and failed Complications that say to treat the result as a Critical Failure) to the following:</p>\n<p>Roll a d6. On a 1–2, the runner loses his turn. On a 3–4, he takes Fatigue. On a 5–6, he tumbles over an edge and must make an immediate @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll (a free action). Success means he catches a ledge, railing, gutter, or other precipice and can pull himself up with a Strength roll (a free action each round). Failure means he’s stuck for the turn and can take no further actions. A Critical Failure means the hero falls d6 × 10 stories—or whatever the GM feels is appropriate for that city.</p>\n<h3>Deep Space</h3>\n<p>The <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Unstable Platform]{Unstable Platform}</strong> penalty usually applies in chases, but it can be ignored in the vacuum of deep space!</p>\n<h3>Dogfights &amp; Duels</h3>\n<p>The Chase rules generally assume the combatants are moving in the same direction—chasing prey, toward a target or escape route, etc. But the rules can also easily accommodate dogfights, tank battles, demolition derbies, and aerial or naval duels by arranging the Chase Cards in different ways.</p>\n<p>Instead of dealing the Chase Cards in a straight line, arrange them in a 4 × 4 grid to create a more fluid battlefield. Vehicles move and count Range orthogonally (no diagonals). Use common sense when determining weapon arcs and vehicle facings. A pirate ship with cannons on either side, for example, can fire left and right on an action, but can’t fire at targets ahead or behind them on the same action.</p>\n<p>Change the Range Increment as makes sense for your particular battle, letting the weapons with the longest ranges reach across the board but forcing those with shorter range to get in close.</p>\n<p>You can also place special cards in the grid to represent asteroid fields or space stations in space battles, whirlpools and islands in naval battles, and so on. They might be impassable or have their own special rules as you see fit.</p>\n<h3>Naval Chases</h3>\n<p>Bringing a target to battle on the high seas can take many hours or even days depending on the weather and the initial distance between the vessels.</p>\n<p>If the ships are more than a mile apart when first encountered, assume the first phase of the chase represents the pursuer trying to bring the prey to battle. Treat each round as about four hours (or much longer in the age of sail if the wind is against them) and the Range Increment as a <em>mile</em>.</p>\n<p>Once the pursuer reaches the same Chase Card as the prey, “zoom” in on the action and run the chase as usual, perhaps using the <strong>Dogfights and Duels</strong> option discussed above.</p>\n<div style=\"display:block;margin:auto;width:50%\"><img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg120_quote_yar.webp\" /></div>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Vehicles on the Tabletop</h2>\n<p>For car or boat chases and aerial or space duels with a lot of movement and mobility, use the Chase system. In tabletop battles where vehicles must operate in a confined space (and you want to use miniatures!), use these simple rules to handle the movement of most common land vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Movement</h3>\n<p>Vehicles can move up to 12″ on the tabletop (or their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} if slower than that) without having to make maneuvering rolls or worry about crashing into obstacles. At that speed they can move as desired and end their turn facing any direction.</p>\n<p>If a driver wants to go faster, up to 24″ per turn unless the GM says otherwise given the terrain and situation, he can do so but must make a maneuvering roll. The GM should assign a penalty (−1 to −4) if the move takes the vehicle through @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Difficult Ground}, tight turns, or hazards. If the roll is successful, the vehicle ends its move wherever the driver wants. Failure means the vehicle moves only 12″.</p>\n<p>A Critical Failure means the vehicle goes @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}. If that indicates a collision, the GM can move it into the nearest obstacle or decide it’s a feature not modeled on the tabletop such as a pothole, small ditch, fallen log, battlefield debris, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ramming is an opposed test of maneuvering skills. If the attacker hits, use the damage described under the <strong>Ram</strong> maneuver above.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/vehicles_on_tabletop.webp\" /> <em style=\"width:50%\">Printable \"Figure Flats\" of characters, vehicles, and monsters are available for most of our settings!</em></aside>\n<h2 class=\"example\">Example: Red's Dead Redemption</h2>\n<p>Red is chasing a notorious space pirate who injured Gabe in a previous encounter. Both Red and the pirate have identical star fighters.</p>\n<p>Red is on the first Chase Card and the pirate’s on the fifth. That means the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is 200″ (4 × the Range Increment of 50″). That’s Long Range for her Gatling laser so she decides to get closer. She makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll as a free action and gets a 7, +2 for her ship’s Handling gives her a 9. That’s a success and a raise so she moves two Chase Cards closer.</p>\n<p>There are now two Chase Cards between Red and her target, or 100″. That’s Medium Range for her Gatling so she fires it up.</p>\n<p>The base TN is 4, −2 for Medium Range (no penalty for Unstable Platform in space!). The Rate of Fire on the Gatling is 4 though, so Red rolls four d10s (her Shooting skill) and a Wild die. She gets one regular hit and one with a raise. The regular hit causes 16 damage, which is 2 over the pirate’s Toughness of 14. The pirate must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll (he makes it) or go Out of Control. Since this is a Chase, Red also Bumps him a card <em>away</em>—a smart move since the pirate goes next.</p>\n<p>Now Red resolves the hit with a raise. This one causes a Wound. She can’t Bump the pirate again in her same turn, but he still has to make another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll or go @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}. He fails this time and rolls a 3 on the table, which gives him another Wound. Since he took Wounds from the attack, he takes a Critical Hit as well. It’s a 5, so his Top Speed drops 10%. He’s now slower than Red so she adds +1 to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} rolls when changing positions.</p>\n<h2>Crews</h2>\n<p>Passengers and crews go in whatever order they decide on their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card}. This can make for dramatic and interactive experiences with a little narrative interpretation. On a pirate ship, the captain makes the maneuvering (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating}) rolls. The rest of the player characters fire a cannon, take a shot with a musket (if the captain is willing to get that close!), yell insults at the enemy (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test}), or point out hazards (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support} for the captain’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating} rolls).</p>\n<p>The player character-controlled “bridge crew” of a starship can do the same. Maybe the captain focuses on Testing the enemy in a duel of wits and leaves the maneuvering rolls to the Navigation officer. The Weapons officers fire weapons while the Engineer Supports the navigator, captain, or gunners as needed each turn.</p>\n<h2>Reminders</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add or subtract Chase Cards to the track as needed.</li>\n<li>A character’s <em>Action Card</em> determines if a Complication occurs, but his <em>Chase Card</em> determines any penalty and results of failure.</li>\n<li>Dealing with a Complication is a free action.</li>\n<li>Evade and Hold Steady are good options for characters who don’t expect frequent chases and so don’t have Edges like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Steady Hands]{Steady Hands}.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/space-battle.webp\" /></div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_czmcjlz6r8u","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"1coelZeIBDQ8pdth","name":"Half-orc","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Half-orc</h1>\n<p>Thousands of years beforc humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs of Khorvaire</h3>\n<p>With the rise ofthe dragonmarked House Tharashk, ores and half-orcs have spread through the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and beyond. In general, the people of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} know little about half-ores. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a \"simpleton from the swamps.\"</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Orc Heritage: </span>Half-orcs may retain the strength of their orc parent.

{"_id":"29HAr1v8ndcIgVdv","name":"Hobgoblin","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Hobgoblin</h1>\n<p>The goblinoid species-goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p>\n<h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</span> Hobgoblin eyes are accustomed to the dark of Khyber.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Schools]{Schools}</h3>\n<p>A wizard's intense studies lead him down two paths—a \"universalist\" who dabbles in all the various \"schools\" of magic, or a \"specialist\" who focuses on a school at the expense of other studies.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Specialists</strong></em> designate one favored @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Schools of Magic]{school} and two opposition @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Schools of Magic]{schools} from the list below.

For this reason, each wizard maintains a spellbook with the spells he’s translated and acquired. He studies them daily, transcribing their mystical patterns onto his mind.</p>\n<p>The link to the book is far more than rote memorization—it is an arcane bond with the power and patterns within. If a wizard doesn’t have access to his spellbook, he may continue to cast normally until the next sunset or sunrise (whichever comes first). After that, the magical imprint on his mind fades and he can no longer cast them.</p>\n<p>Wizards may only carry one active spellbook at a time. The mountains of scrolls, magical notations, and research needed to prepare another cannot be carried with the wizard and must be stored safely somewhere. It takes a week of work and 500 gp to create a replacement spellbook once the wizard has access to his magical notes.</p>\n<p>When a wizard finds a new spellbook or scroll, the spells it contains become available as choices to the wizard when he next chooses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers} Edge. Moreover, a wizard taking the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers} Edge can learn a third new power, if all the new powers are learned from scrolls and spellbooks.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Mages must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Wizards are some of the most versatile casters in Eberron.

{"_id":"5r9kaya39Lic4mah","name":"Conviction","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h2>Conviction</h2>\n<p>Conviction is a special award granted when a character experiences a great victory or catastrophic misfortune. If possible, use a themed token to note the award; maybe a Marshal’s Badge for <cite>Deadlands</cite>, a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{Benny} of a different color, a toy doubloon for <cite>50 Fathoms</cite>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Conviction can be spent to add a d6 to all a character’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Trait} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dealing Damage]{damage} totals until the beginning of her next @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Actions]{turn}. This die can @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Ace}, and its result is added to the final total.</p>\n<p>Conviction tokens aren’t @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{Bennies} and can’t be used as such. They <em>are</em> kept between sessions, however.</p>\n<p>A character may maintain Conviction from round to round by spending a Benny (at the start of his turn, before it runs out). Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p>\n<h3>Triumph And Tragedy</h3>\n<p>Conviction is granted for personal triumph and tragedy, drawing on a character’s entire background, including—but not limited to—his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}.</p>\n<p>Savage settings may also grant Conviction for certain world-specific actions or events.</p>\n<p><strong>Triumph:</strong> Characters gain Conviction when they overcome significant obstacles core to their overall goals and motivations. This might mean defeating powerful enemies, saving a true love, or overcoming some great mystery or problem.</p>\n<p>The victory should be an achievement over and above the usual. A vampire hunter in <cite>Rippers</cite> shouldn’t get Conviction every time he kills a vampire, for example, but he might when he wipes out an entire coven or slays a powerful master vamp­ire. A super hero might gain Conviction when she saves her true love from a death trap or the clutches of a powerful villain. She wouldn’t earn it just because her boyfriend is in a dangerous encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Some of the most interesting heroes of fiction, film, and legend spend as much time battling their personal demons as they do fighting their foes. Eventually these same issues give them strength as they work through their grief or overcome obstacles to rise once more against the challenges they face.</p>\n<p>When a character experiences a significant personal loss or destructive event, and the GM feels it’s appropriate, he gains Conviction. The death of a loved one or close friend (including a party member he was close to), losing an important job, giving in to harmful character flaws and vices, being removed from a case or quest, or getting framed for a crime are all classic examples of heroic tragedy.</p>\n<p>These might happen in the course of the game, but players should also proactively suggest their own ideas to the Game Master. Consider your hero’s backstory and occasionally look for ways to do what your favorite authors do to their characters—torture them! Think about what’s important to them and threaten it or take it away. Most of the time this should be done as a quick narrative tale or a scene with a little interaction and roleplaying so as not to distract from the main campaign or the other players’ time, but occasionally it might inspire a side-trek or adventure to regain—or avenge!—whatever was lost.</p>\n<p>Note that earning Conviction for harmful behavior is motivation for players in a game to occasionally spotlight their character’s dark side. It is not an endorsement or rationalization of poor conduct in the real world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"example\">Example: Red's Rage</h2>\n<p>Emily is Red, a fighter in a fantasy campaign. She has “anger management issues” but didn’t take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Mean]{Mean} Hindrance because she’s had her problem under control for a year or so. But it’s a fun part of her backstory and Emily loves roleplaying constantly managing her character’s temper.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Red and her constant ally Gabe failed in their last adventure. Emily decides this is a good time for Red to go on a rampage. She narrates a story about going into town and terrorizing everyone in sight with her surly attitude. During the course of a “bad day,” she breaks a window, turns over an apple cart, and even insults a friar’s mule!</p>\n<p>The GM loves Emily’s story and awards her a point of Conviction. In the game, Red is barred from the local tavern, has to pay for all the damage she caused, and is refused help by the friar (the town’s only healer!) until she performs some act of penance (a new quest!)</p>\n<p>More importantly, Emily told a story about her heroine’s tragic flaw—and has a point of Conviction to carry her through the next chapter of her quest.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Setting Rules] Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Born A Hero]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Born from War]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Conviction]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Creative Combat]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dumb Luck]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dynamic Backlash]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fanatics]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fast Healing]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory and Infamy]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Gritty Damage]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hard Choices]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Heroes Never Die]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.High Adventure]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.More Skill Points]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.No Power Points]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Unarmored Hero]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wound Cap]</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zcw12kzdfjm","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"6nGFpS8It1pGo578","name":"Kalashtar","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Kalashtar</h1>\n<p>The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union ofhumanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams-spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p>\n<h3>Bound to Spirits</h3>\n<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p>\n<h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3>\n<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dual Mind: </span>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

{"_id":"712V5zxIGyc8K10r","name":"Dramatic Tasks","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Dramatic Tasks</h1>\n<p>Heroes often find themselves in tense and dangerous situations such as disabling a complex trap, climbing a rock face while under fire from archers, or rescuing people from a burning building or sinking ship with a definite — and sometimes deadly — time limit.</p>\n<p>This system simulates these events and helps the Game Master insert some drama into what would otherwise be simple skill rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Dramatic Tasks are great for tense actions that must be performed in a hurry or have disastrous effects if failed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> The heroes make skill rolls to accumulate \"Task Tokens\" and resolve the event before time runs out.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>The GM starts by figuring out what the task is, how long the party has to complete it, and how many tokens they need for success.</p>\n<h3>Single Person Tasks</h3>\n<p>Use these guidelines when only a single character can attempt the task each turn (others can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Challenging:</span> Collect four Task Tokens in three rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a trap in the dark, pick a lock before a guard returns, disengage a moving horse-team from its wagon.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Difficult:</span> Collect six Task Tokens in four rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a trap in the middle of combat, cast a ritual, sail a craft to shore during a storm.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Complex:</span> Collect eight Task Tokens in five rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a particularly complicated and/or dangerous trap, Pick a very difficult lock or series of locks before a patrol returns, cast a large and powerful ritual, repair a complicated machine with multiple moving parts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Multi-Person Tasks</h3>\n<p>If more than one person can attempt the task at once, such as crewing a ship, the GM must set the number of rounds and tokens required for victory herself. Here are some guidelines.</p>\n<p>Assume each player will average one success per turn. Use that as a guideline if you want the task to be \"fair,\" and set the number of rounds from three to five as appropriate. A party of five given three rounds to save a galleon in a storm, for example, needs to accumulate 15 Task Tokens in three rounds. Increase or decrease the number of tokens to make it more or less challenging.</p>\n<p>If the number of tokens achieved is a measure of success rather than a straight win/fail condition, such as rescuing victims from a fire or hauling up bags of gold from a collapsing mineshaft, simply set the possible number of tokens that may be gathered in the time allowed. Each token gathered represents a person saved, a bag recovered, etc. It’s up to you whether it’s possible to save them all (using the guide above) or not.</p>\n<p>Let the party choose how many will attempt the task, especially if there’s something else going on at the same time. Deciding how many heroes will break into the jail to rescue a friend while the others fight off the corrupt city guard allows <em>them</em> to choose their tactics.</p>\n<h2>Performing the Task</h2>\n<p>Characters are dealt @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} as usual during a Dramatic Task. Those attempting the task make relevant skill checks and get a Task Token for each success and raise. Failure means no progress and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} reduces progress by one (if any has been made).</p>\n<p>The skills that can be used to accumulate tokens depends on the situation. They might be defined, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to disable a trap, or they might be open — a heroic paladin might use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to carry people from a burning building while a mage uses <em>telekinesis</em> (@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting}) to do the same.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Skills</h3>\n<p>The GM can break tasks down into steps if she likes, each of which might require different skills. If disabling a difficult trap in the dark, for example, the heroes might first have to get two tokens to get the feel for their surroundings using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, then three more tokens using Thievery to cut all three trip wires in the correct order.</p>\n<p>Requiring multiple skills throughout the task makes it more difficult since raises from one type of skill check don’t carry over to the other. In the trap example above, for example, the first step requires two Notice successes. Additional successes <em>don’t</em> carry over to the Thievery rolls needed afterward.</p>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>If a character’s Action Card is a Club, something has gone wrong. Attempts to resolve the task (or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} it!) are made at an additional −2.</p>\n<p>Worse, if a roll is failed during a Complication, the Dramatic Task fails — the trap springs, the lock jams, a victim cannot be saved, and so on. The character may choose <em>not</em> to attempt a roll on a turn he has a Complication — it just costs him precious time.</p>\n<p><strong>Support:</strong> Characters assisting (via Support)also suffer the Complication penalty, and an additional −2 if <em>their</em> Action Card is a Club! @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} on their part just subtracts from the lead’s roll as usual, however, it doesn’t cause the entire task to fail.</p>\n<h3>Death Traps</h3>\n<p>Think carefully before designing Dramatic Tasks that might wipe out the entire party if failed. The threat of catastrophe should be very real but you don’t want a couple of bad die rolls to end the entire game.</p>\n<p>Instead of total disaster, maybe the party has a moment to dive clear before the trap triggers. They don’t perish, but later awake in the care of a local healer or are captured and find themselves about to experience a new type of adventure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"example\">Example: Dragon fire!</h2>\n<p>An evil red dragon roams the countryside, burning farms and villages throughout the land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Seelah]{Seelah} the paladin and @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Harsk]{Harsk} the ranger watch in horror as the dragon breathes fire down on their favorite tavern. The pair rush to aid the choking and gasping patrons attempting to flee the burning building.</p>\n<p>The Game Master decides rescuing the survivors is a three-round, Multi-Person Dramatic Task. There are 10 patrons. Each success saves one of them from the inferno.</p>\n<p>On the first round, Seelah and Harsk roll @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to run into the tavern and drag someone out. Both get a raise, so that's four citizens saved!</p>\n<p>The next round, Harsk gets a Complication. The GM decides he becomes trapped in one of the back rooms and must make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} roll at −2. If he fails, it takes him too long to escape and he won't be able to save any more patrons. Harsk draws his brother's trusty @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Axe, Battle]{battleaxe} and hacks his way free. He decides to go with it and narrates using his Fighting to hack open a hole in the wall for the survivors. He's successful, and Seelah gets a raise this turn with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} — yelling at the locals to help throw water on the fire. That's seven total patrons saved.</p>\n<p>On the third round, Seelah gets a Complication and fails — she's choking on smoke and can't help. Fortunately, after spending a few Bennies, Harsk manages to get two @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raises} and pull the last patrons from the fire.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/dragon-fire.webp\" /></div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_czmcjlz6r8u","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

troubadours, song mages, are sorcerers who work their magic through the power of motion, song, poetry, and storytelling. The art is extremely ancient and found among all races, though the dragonmarked House Phiarlan maintains the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, and it has dominated the industry for centuries. The house trains and licenses performers, and maintains many of the grand stages. The finest schools of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} are known as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Five Demesnes}. As well as being spellcasters, bards are also storytellers and poets, able to recount epic poems and stories from memory. Some play instruments, but most simply use their voice to enthrall their audience. Their talents make them popular guests. Finding a warm place to sleep and a hot meal usually requires nothing more than a tale to entertain the host.</p>\n<p>From the ancient goblin dirge singers to the entertainers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, many cultures embrace the bard or skald as entertainer who also serves as a historian or bearer of news, a chronicler if you will. To survive on the road, a trouper must be clever, charismatic, and versatile above all. Whether a tryst with a foe resolves by silver-tongue or adamantine blade, an adventuring bard's worth truly comes from the ability to improvise a magical talent to charm, lull, or simply assist with a nearly limitless reservoir of practical knowledge and skill. While the common trope sings of a troubadour whose magic harmonizes with some cosmic symphony, those who have traversed Khorvaire have learned that inspiration is the true magic of any bardic exhibition, regardless of the medium.</p>\n<p>Bards usually don’t end up as wandering minstrels or street performers—any expert with some training and skill can fill that role. Instead, some skalds use their magical abilities to unearth ancient lore, while others use their interpersonal skills and mystical music to advance their careers as spies, ambassadors, diplomats, and chroniclers. As such, skalds find employ as adventurers, as well as in governments and among the mercantile houses.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} produces a large number of bards, since the gnomes’ love of knowledge makes them particularly well suited to this class. In other areas, bards appear most often in the large cities and towns throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}, and (particularly) @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Bards with wilder ties are found in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, particularly among the druid sect of the Greensingers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that pervades Eberron: through music. Some bards claim that the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful tune of creation.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for a skald will always manifest as something with the performing arts. Song and sonic trappings would be the most common. But other trappings could include playing an instrument, dancing, a poetic verse, and anything else of the like.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9jz568pflw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes.

However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs.

{"_id":"BdHowOvk1bfJMynW","name":"Elf","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Elf</h1>\n<p>Tens of thousands ofyears ago, the elves of the distant continent of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p>\n<p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p>\n<p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p>\n<p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p>\n<h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em><em> </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p>\n<h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3>\n<p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p>\n<p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile:</span> Elves are graceful and agile.

They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.</p>\n<p>But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often apopear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.</p>\n<p>While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? First of all, aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.</p>\n<p>It takes time for a character to learn to control their mark, and in time people may be hurt. If an aberrant mark grants <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, the person who carries it might have severely burned or even killed a loved one. Imagine having the power to cast charm person but being unable to control it and having people you care about suddenly becoming slavishly devoted to you. All of these factors have led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous, that their marks drive them crazy or turn them into sociopaths. These are things that can happen; people have a right to be afraid. But it is possible for an aberrant to learn to control their mark and to endure the flaw.</p>\n<h3>War of the Mark</h3>\n<p>An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down.

{"_id":"DmImJJ41VXqfAQDu","name":"Half-elf","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Half-elf</h1>\n<p>From the Towering Woods of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} to the slums of Sham, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h3>Khorvar</h3>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture.

Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p>\n<p>When the elves fled to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, the drow remained on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p>\n<p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p>\n<h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3>\n<p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p>\n<p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust.

{"_id":"F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO","name":"1 Making Characters","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Characters</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Savage Eberron</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>Concept</h2>\n<p>Begin your adventure by thinking about the kind of character you want to play. Do you want to try a wily @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Wizard]{wizard}, a burly @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Barbarian]{barbarian}, a tricksy @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rogue]{rogue}, or some original idea you’ve come up with yourself? The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p>\n<p>For the world of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, take a close look at the Class Edges subsection in Setting Edges @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{here}. These special abilities form the foundation of the typical player character types found in Eberron. Keep these in mind as you follow the rest of these steps so you can build toward those if you want to play a traditional Eberron-style hero.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry</h2>\n<p>This core rule book comes with seven recommended ancestries to use when creating player characters. See ancestries for more info @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{here}.</p>\n<h2>Hindrances</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p>\n<p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{attribute or skill} points, take @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p>\n<p>A Major @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p>\n<p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li>\n<li>Choose an Edge</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Gain another skill point, or</li>\n<li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>\n<p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p>\n<h3>Attributes</h3>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}).</p>\n<p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless an ancestral ability, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional character points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses, in the list starting in the Skills subsection in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits} for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{Races} start with a d6 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p>\n<h3>Derived Statistics</h3>\n<p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{Combat}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{cause harm} (explained later in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules}).</p>\n<p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor}, plus @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso. Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}, above.</p>\n<h2>Edges</h2>\n<p>Attributes and skills are a character’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p>\n<p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, every character starts with a Class Edge for free. The character must qualify for the Edge as usual. (If a player doesn’t want to take a Class Edge, she may take a free Background or Professional Edge she qualifies for instead.)</p>\n<p>Characters get additional Edges by taking @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}, from racial abilities (such as Humans’ Adaptability), or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advances} once play begins.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive list of Edges for use in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is available @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{here}.</p>\n<h2>Gear</h2>\n<p>Player characters have 300 gold pieces (or “gp”) to purchase any of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Personal Weapons]{weapons}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{armor}, and adventuring gear presented in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Gear]{the Gear Chapter}.</p>\n<p>This might represent everything the character owns or it may represent only “adventuring” gear, with the hero’s more mundane belongings stored at a home or elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp')\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp\" />\n<p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you see fit. Ask yourself why she’s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game? Why did she join the Pathfinders?</p>\n<p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p>\n<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p>\n<h3>Deities and alignment</h3>\n<p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p>\n<p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Game Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your GM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p>\n<p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} section.</p>\n<div>\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Character creation summary</h1>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

(Half-Giants are from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} are descendants of ancient giant explorers from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p>\n<p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p>\n<h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3>\n<p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Adar]{Adar}, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Cumbersome]{Cumbersome}: </span>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures.

They treat @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} as linked to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} instead of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} for purposes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advancement}. The character may also resist @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Tests} with Strength if she chooses. Finally, half-giants increase the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Range]{Short Range} of any thrown item by +1. Double that for the adjusted @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Range]{Medium Range}, and double again for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Range]{Long Range}.

When used in this way, Persuasion isn’t a single\n    exchange but several hours of networking, hobnobbing, carousing, drinks,\n    gifts, bribes, or entertaining. This might represent time roaming a\n    marketplace, a series of meetings with important people, or an evening of\n    food and drink.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Success grants most of what the character wants, though it may take a while,\n    cost some money, or require a favor in return.

A raise means she gets more info,\n    gets it faster, or her victims are too scared or otherwise preoccupied to\n    plot revenge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Failure means the bully doesn’t get anything useful. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}\n    means she ends the evening with a fat lip, black eye, or broken nose (see\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>).

{"_id":"JyNoL7h3CpqMJlIP","name":"Random Traps","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h2>Random Traps</h2>\n<p>Draw two cards from the Action Deck whenever you need a trap on the fly. These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p>\n<p>The GM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p>\n<h3>First Card</h3>\n<p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated. Use the suit entry of the second card on the Trap Type table below to determine the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} die for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Detecting: </strong>Detecting a trap requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll. Unless a character has @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{running} hero rolls at –2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists.

The GM draws two cards. He gets a 3 of Hearts and the King of Diamonds.</p>\n<p>The 3H tells the GM that there is a +1 bonus to the Notice roll to spot the trap (indicated by the 3) and a –1 modifier to disarm it (indicated by the Hearts). The trap is fairly complex, but not very well disguised. Unfortunately, Aelric isn't looking out for traps and walks straight onto it. The GM decides it is a pressure plate mechanism.</p>\n<p>As this occurs outside of combat, Aelric rolls his Notice to avoid Surprise. He adds +1 from the first card's value, and scores 8. The GM tells Aelric he hears an audible click as his foot hits the floor and deals him an action card. Aelric declares he wants to move clear of the square he is on. Before he can do this, however, the trap tries to interrupt him.</p>\n<p>The trap has a fixed d10 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} and rolls a 9. Aelric rolls his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} and gets a lousy 5. Aelric has been hit by a falling lump of masonry (as determined by the King value of the second card). He suffers 2d8 damage (determined by the Diamonds).</p>\n<p>Note that although the trap scored a raise over Aelric's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} total, this was not an attack roll and so it does not deal +1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>Aelric suffers 11 damage, enough to cause him a wound.

{"_id":"KVIBbTL2NoneXQ18","name":"Mass Battles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Mass battles</h1>\n  <p>\n    Many adventures feature heroes traveling about the land, gathering @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Allies]{allies} to\n    thwart some inevitable foe or ravaging horde. They build coalitions, train\n    armies, discover powerful artifacts, and finally stand against the enemy in\n    desperate and glorious battle.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The rules presented here allow the Game Master to handle a small warband\n    holding a fort against an undead horde, a siege against a walled city, or\n    even full divisions of troops fighting across a massive battlefield. The\n    process is abstract, but it provides a narrative base for heroes to plan,\n    get involved, and take part in the carnage!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the Mass Battle rules when you\n    need to resolve a large conflict that can go either way, and also allow the\n    player characters to have a role in its outcome. The culmination of these\n    tales is not always a foregone conclusion, and failure can be just as\n    interesting as victory!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Each side has a number of “Force Tokens” equal\n    to its relative strength and size. Commanders roll their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} skill each\n    turn. The winner reduces his rival’s force until one side or the other\n    breaks.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Setup</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    To start, give the larger or more powerful army 10 Force Tokens. Give the\n    opposing army a proportional number of tokens. If one army has 10,000\n    warriors, for example, and the other has 7,000, give the smaller army seven\n    tokens. These represent the troops, ships, and other assets in each side’s\n    army.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Adjust the ratio as makes sense to account for special or elite troops,\n    better equipment, and so on. If one army is half as powerful as another, for\n    example, give one side 10 Force Tokens and the other five. Get close enough\n    to give a reasonable approximation of relative strength. The dice and the\n    players’ actions will handle the rest.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Battle</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    At the start of each round, the player characters discuss and decide on\n    their plan. Then the attackers make an opposed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} roll against the\n    defender. Add the modifiers below as appropriate to each roll.\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Battle Modifiers</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Circumstance</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+1 per<br />point of<br />advantage</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Force Bonus:</strong> The side with the most Force Tokens\n            adds +1 for each point of difference.

The Game Master should change this as suits her needs or the\n    story. A more reserved fight might have four- or even eight-hour rounds,\n    while a siege might be a battle round per day.\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Battle Results</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Result</th>\n      </tr>\n      \n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Tie</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>Draw:</strong> Both sides lose one Force Token.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Success</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Marginal Victory:</strong> The victor loses one Force Token, the defeated loses two.\n          </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Raise</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Victory:</strong> The defeated army loses two Force Tokens.\n          </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <h3>Morale</h3>\n  <p>\n    After an army loses one or more Force Tokens, its leader makes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Sprit} check modified by these circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Morale Modifiers</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Circumstance</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>−1</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>Each Force Token lost so far.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army is made up mostly of @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Undead]{undead} or other @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Fearless]{fearless} troops.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army is within fortifications or prepared positions.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army cannot retreat or will be killed if it does.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <p>\n    Success means the leader cajoles the army to fight on.

Animals may attack during their rider’s action if desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Horsemanship:</strong> Characters who wish to fight from horseback must use the lowest of their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Riding]{Riding} skills. This also applies to other more extraordinary mounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Falling:</strong> If a character is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Stunned]{Stunned}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wounded} while mounted, or his mount is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated}, he must make a Riding roll.

Increase the damage by an additional die or two if the mount is particularly fast, flies, or the rider falls in particularly rough or dangerous terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Missed Ranged Attacks:</strong> Mounts and riders are affected by the <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Innocent Bystandards]{Innocent Bystander}</strong> rules. If a shot intended at a rider rolls a 1, it hits the mount instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Wounded Mounts:</strong> When an animal is Shaken or Wounded, it rears or bucks. A rider must make a Riding roll to stay mounted, or falls as above.</p>\n<h3>Charging</h3>\n<p>A rider on a charging mount adds +4 to his damage roll with a successful Fighting attack. To be considered charging, the rider must have moved at least 5″ (10 yards) or more in a relatively straight line toward his foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting Weapons:</strong> A weapon with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reach]{Reach} of 1 or greater can be “set” against a cavalry attack. To do so, the attacker must be on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hold]{Hold} and win an opposed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll to interrupt as usual.

{"_id":"N3asvOCX2XfyN4jt","name":"Languages","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Languages</h1>\n<p>In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language. Members of all races in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends, while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"</p>\n<h3>Welcome to Eberron</h3>\n<p>With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table.

The process isn't like the spells of a wizard or the tools of an artificer, nor is it a divine petition to a higher power. Well, not exactly. Legend recounts how the great progenitor dragon Eberron enveloped the jealous evil of Khyber in the living prison that would become the world. If arcane magic comes from the tears of Siberys above, then Druidic magic is the blood and breath of Eberron herself, granting power to those who seek to defend her and the natural order from the threats beyond.</p>\n<p>Most druids are swathed in tradition, usually initiated by a sect that teaches the secrets of this primal magic while also charging the aspirant with specific duties. While some sects are loosely aligned, each one has its own ideas as to the role their kind should play in the world.</p>\n<p>Most druids come from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature's spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Civilization</h3>\n<p>Most druids come from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature's spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<p>You can roll on the <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore-tables.Druidic Beliefs]{Druidic Beliefs}</strong> table to see how your druid views civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Sovereign Host</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the Sovereign Host is a civilized faith with shrines in the great cities of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} but a number of shrines to deities tied to nature can be found in the wilds. Balinor is the Sovereign of the Hunt, Arawai brings nature's bounty, and the Devourer embodies its destructive power and the hunger that reclaims its waste. In Eberron, a priest of Balinor isn't inherently required to follow one trail or the other, but the main differences between the two lay in how command of nature is granted, and the purpose for which they use it. While it's common for the two paths to recognize one another, such respect isn't always equal.</p>\n<p>From a philosophical perspective, a druid is an envoy of nature with a connection to the environment itself, not a servant of a higher power. By contrast, the cleric serves a higher power and holds dominion over the natural world. While druids shun such metal armaments, nature clerics usually practice combat in manmade heavy metal armors until proficient. Yet, clerics lack the primal understanding required to communicate in Druidic and to assume Wild Shape, which is a reflection of the druid's deep connection to the natural world.</p>\n<p>Such differences lead to a deep disconnect between the typical druid and a nature worshiping cleric. The Warden of the Wood might see the priests of Balinor as an arrogant outsider, a city-dweller who believes that humanoids hold some sort of divine right over the planet, which is admittedly often the case. To the priestess of Arawai, nature is something that serves the people and her primary concern is ensuring a bountiful harvest, not driving farmers from their fields.</p>\n<p>While this is the obvious contrast, it's possible to create a character who uses one class while following the opposite path. Perhaps you want to play a priest of Balinor but you love the idea of hunting in the form of a wolf, or you want to be Ashbound but have no interest in ever assuming a Wild Shape. While there will be the occasional disconnect, like the Ashbound cleric can't use Wild Shape, the Balinor druid can't turn undead, look to juxtapose these ideas to best match the story and experience you're looking for, using backgrounds like the acolyte or outlander to cultivate the option.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Druids must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Druids interact constantly with nature, drawing all their power from it. They regularly perform various rituals while they rest or pray. They regularly tend to the natural order of things. This opens their conduits of power to the natural energies and allows them to activate powers later without begining the appeal in the moment. </p>\n<p>Druidic powers are cast through chants, talismans, and talking with nature itself. Depending on the spell, the druid may cast bones, sprinkle of ash, rubbing a talisman, beseeching the forces of nature. Trappings for the spells of druids should all include natural components or aspects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9jz568pflw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

The provisions cost 500 pieces of eight and take up one cargo space.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the ship runs out of food, the captain could convert a cargo space worth of “Food” (a commodity) to 50 provisions. This would feed his 12-man crew for about 4 days.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunger:</strong> Wild Cards suffer from starvation normally (one provision a day counts as adequate food). For the rest of the crew, make a group Vigor roll each day they have half rations (one provision for every two men). Subtract 2 if the men have less than this.</p>\n<p>Should the crew collectively reach Incapacitated state, 10% of the men perish each day from starvation. Most crews mutiny long before this starts to happen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Nautical Keywords</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Armor and Swimming]{Armor and Swimming}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Boarding]{Boarding}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Cabin Fever]{Cabin Fever}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Careening]{Careening}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Crew Pay]{Crew Pay}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Crew Provisions]{Crew Provisions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fighting Below Deck]{Fighting Below Deck}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Nautical Contact]{Nautical Contact}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Navigation]{Navigation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranks of Archers]{Ranks of Archers}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ship Fire]{Ship Fire}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Sinking]{Sinking}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ship Repairs]{Ship Repairs}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Storms at Sea]{Storms at Sea}</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_1p9lwunt7xn","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"QkLv9wmRL6xcz9Iq","name":"Warforged","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Warforged</h1>\n<p>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>\n<h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p>\n<h3>Warforged Personality</h3>\n<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>\n<p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Built for War:</span> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war.

{"_id":"TGVqpeUJkPHC4La6","name":"Eneko","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Eneko</h1>\n<p>The Eneko of Skyarn are distant descendants of ogres and half-giants. As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p>\n<h3>Free People</h3>\n<p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p>\n<p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3>\n<p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}'s native humans and giant explorers from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Riedrans and less trusting Syrk humans claim the cult of Karrak is a convenient front for the practice of dark magic.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Eneko are natural strong.

{"_id":"URSgjRYJvOeHkDtt","name":"2 Trappings","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Trappings</h1>\n<p>Trappings allow the core powers presented in this chapter to have many different appearances. They don't usually have a game effect of their own, but are important for atmosphere and theme.</p>\n<p>One character might fire magical missiles of glowing white energy while another hurls deadly icicles. Both use the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em> power and share the same mechanics, but they look and \"feel\" different.</p>\n<p>Trappings <em>do</em> matter when an obstacle or opponent has a particular strength or weakness. If an ice troll suffers +4 damage from fire- or heat-based attacks, for example, a <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Blast]{blast}</em> a player describes as a fireball counts as a fire attack and does +4 damage.</p>\n<p>Once described, a power’s Trappings don’t change unless the caster uses an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advance}.</p>\n<p>A character can alter the power’s effects or Trappings as she wishes using <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Synergy]</h3>\n<p>Sometimes logic dictates a power’s Trapping should have some additional effect. Zapping someone with a lightning bolt while they’re standing in water should cause additional damage, for example.</p>\n<p>When this occurs, the GM can decide there’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Synergy]{synergy} that either increases or decreases the effect or damage (GM’s call) by +2 or −2.</p>\n<p>Oppositional forces, such as fire and ice or light and darkness, <em>don’t</em> have synergy against one another (though such effects are sometimes accounted for in some creatures’ Special Abilities. If a fire <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Blast]{blast}</em> hits ice armor<em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{(protection)}</em>, for example, there’s no additional effect because they cancel each other out.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Adding and Changing Trappings]</h2>\n<p>A character can learn two new powers when he takes the <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers}</strong> Edge. He may instead add Trappings to his powers in place of one or two of the new powers. A hero who takes the New Powers Edge, for example, could choose one new power and add an ice Trapping to her <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>. The GM may also allow a player to <em>change</em> the Trapping of existing power when she gains an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advance}.

A chef might use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Elemental Manipulation]{elemental manipulation}</em> to heat and prepare food, while a blacksmith uses <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair}</em> to perform minor repairs and guidance to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.</p>\n<p>Far more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals-even spells that can't normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Crafters such as blacksmiths, potters, architects, and weavers often learn a single ritual in addition to their particular craft. Their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} varies depending on the particular craft they are in. A forgesmith would use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair] as their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} while a locksmith would use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]. </p>\n<p>All of a magewrights powers are cast through ritual casting which does not use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{Power Points}. This extends the casting time from one round to 10 minutes per @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{Power Points} spent × the power's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Rank}. So a forgesmith casting <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair}</em> would take 10 minutes to cast it, the same forgesmith would require 110 minutes to cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair} </em>to fix a destroyed object. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll halves the time and materials needed to case the power. </p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>As an magewright, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. </p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9jz568pflw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

Edges like Quick or Level Headed <em>do not</em> apply to these additional cards drawn with Bennies. This continues until everyone (including the GM) passes. Then the round begins and no further cards may be drawn.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll Damage:</span> You may spend a Benny to reroll damage. Include any additional dice you may have gained for a raise on the attack roll.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Influence the Story:</span> This one is entirely up to the Game Master, who may allow a character to spend a Benny to find an additional clue if you’re stuck, come up with some mundane but needed item, or push a nonplayer character into being a bit more agreeable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> The party is adrift on a storm-tossed sea. None of the characters purchased navigational equipment, but Harsk the ranger had been aiding their doomed captain through the previous encounters. Harsk's player asks the Game Master if he might have been given his own compass and maps while aiding the captain, and might still have them in his bag. The GM agrees—for a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny}. Harsk suddenly remembers the tools in his pack and turns the boat toward shore.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n<h2>Awarding Bennies</h2>\n<p>It takes a few games to figure out how many @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies} you should award players during a session. In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn’t distracting the flow of the game), toss the player a Benny. When players roleplay a Hindrance, reward them. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p>\n<p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the rogue <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. There’s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but the character is the <em>rogue</em> and wants to prove it to the rest of the party.</p>\n<p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That’s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that got them to this point. <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The “currency” of these chances are those Bennies.</p>\n<p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded for roleplaying their Hindrances the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they’re gained. That’s a fantastic pace. It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some critical resource management for the final showdown.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group. Then you’ll know what’s right for you and your friends.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards and Extras}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait Rolls}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Aces}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{Raises}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Opposed Rolls]{Opposed Rolls}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Uskilled Attempts]{Uskilled Attempts}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{Reroll}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Group Rolls]{Group Rolls}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Player Character Bennies]{Player Character Bennies}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Game Master Bennies]{Player Character Bennies}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Bennies]{Using Bennies}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Conviction]{Conviction}</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_lfsctrpor6f","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/3.

A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} has additional effects noted in the particular power description.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]:</strong> A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} when activating a power is called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]{Backlash}. It causes a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} and all currently active powers instantly terminate.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Casting Requirements]</h3>\n<p>A character must be able to see his target and cannot be <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound}</strong> or silenced.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Maintaining Powers]</h3>\n<p>When a power ends, the caster can spend one @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Point} to extend it by its base @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Duration]{Duration}. If a power’s Duration is five rounds, for example, it can be maintained for another five rounds for 1 Power Point.</p>\n<p>Maintenance is per target but ignores other @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}, so renewing<em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost Trait}</em> on three allies costs 3 Power Points and extends the effect of each another five rounds.</p>\n<p>Unless a power says otherwise, the caster can terminate it as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action}.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Stacking Powers]</h3>\n<p>Powers don't stack beyond their maximum benefit or drawback. This includes effects from magic items that specifically use those powers. A ring that simply says it increases @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} a die type does so even if the wearer's Strength is currently increased by <em>boost Trait</em>(Strength), for example. If the same ring said it boosts @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} a die type, however, it would only stack with the actual spell or other items up to the power's maximum (two die types).</p>\n<p>Powers that target different Traits or abilities, such as <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost/lower Trait}</em>, are considered separate powers in this context. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} may only be increased up to two die types by <em>boost Trait</em>, for example, but @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} and Fighting could both be boosted up to two die types as each one is a separate Trait. Similarly, a sorcerer could cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{protection}</em> (melee) on an ally who's already benefiting from a ring of <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Ring of Protection, Minor]{protection}</em> (ranged).</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Recharging]</h3>\n<p>A character recovers 5 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} per hour spent resting.</p>\n<p>What constitutes rest is up to the GM, but generally, it means sitting, eating, tending wounds, sleeping, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Walking or riding a horse isn’t usually restful, but riding in a cushioned carriage might be.</p>\n<p>A few interruptions don’t stop a character from resting— standing watch, planning, sharpening weapons, and so on (GM’s call).</p>\n<p>An arcane hero can also spend a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny} to regain five Power Points. This is a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action}.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers as Multi-Actions]</h3>\n<p>Each power activated is its own action, and the same or dif­ferent powers may be cast multiple times as a <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}</strong>. A wizard might start combat by invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{protection}</em> and <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Deflection]{deflection}</em>, for example, or a priest might attempt to <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Banish]{banish}</em> a spirit while invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Smite]{smite}</em> on his mace.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shorting]</h3>\n<p>A character may cast a power with <em>fewer</em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} than required (whether she has them or not) by increasing the difficulty of her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll (If there is no skill roll, as with Mystic Powers, the character cannot short the power).</p>\n<p>For every Power Point a character shorts, she suffers a −1 penalty to the roll. Casting a 3-point <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> with 0 Power Points, for example, inflicts a −3 penalty.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shorting]{Shorting} is risky. If a character fails a shorted @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll, it’s consid­ered a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure!}</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_j0wwnk7ly8","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

{"_id":"X3zxtjWCI0OFcn3R","name":"Allies","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Allies</h1>\n  <p>\n    Allies play a big part in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> games. They serve\n    as troops under your hero’s command in war, loyal retainers serving\n    strongholds, or fellow fighters in glorious rebellions against oppression.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use these rules to help keep track\n    of the party’s followers and give them a little extra personality to play\n    off of as well.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Players create, control, and track their own followers and nonplayer character allies.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Using Allies</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Keeping up with allies in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is simple. Just download the Ally Sheet from our website and fill in the blanks.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Allied @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} are divided up among all the players to control. This is a\n    very important part of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> because our adventures\n    often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal\n    retainers, and the game is designed to handle them quickly and easily. It’s\n    also designed for the players to control them — not the Game Master.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    It doesn’t matter whether the <em>characters</em> control the allies, only\n    that the <em>players</em> do. This keeps everyone involved in the action\n    even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes running large combats much\n    easier and more fun for everyone. Of course the GM can always take charge of\n    Extras when the need arises, but with good roleplayers this is rarely\n    necessary.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Allied Personalities</h3>\n  <p>\n    You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Allied Personalities]{Allied Personalities}</strong> table. Jot down the keyword on the\n    Ally Sheet so you and your Game Master have a little insight into each\n    particular ally’s character.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Consider these general impressions with no particular game effect. They help\n    both the player and GM decide just how an ally might react in a given\n    situation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a party of adventurers tasks a retainer with keeping watch, it's helpful to know which ones are Observant and which ones are Lazy!\n  </p>\n\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"4\">Allied Personalties</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">d20</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">d20</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Treacherous</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">11</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Crude</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Cruel</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">12</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Agile</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Old</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">13</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Observant</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>4</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Happy</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">14</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Clueless</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Experience</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">15</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Mysterious</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>6</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Gung-Ho</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">16</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Creative</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>7</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Lazy</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">17</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Artistic</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>8</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Sneaky</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">18</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Fearless</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>9</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Bright</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">19</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Cowardly</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>10</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Young</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">20</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Heroic</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <h3>Allies &amp; Advancement</h3>\n  <p>\n    Allies can improve their abilities as well.

This makes for\n    dramatic situations and realistic logistical problems while eliminating the\n    bookkeeping.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM can always decide otherwise, of course. Perhaps the troops are told\n    to fight with hand weapons instead of their bows and crossbows, or they\n    don’t get to fire off more than a couple of shots before the fight is over.\n  </p>\n\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/p144_figure_collage.webp\" />\n  </div>\n\n  <h2>Typical Allies</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Here are a few typical archetypes you might use for your\n    <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game.

{"_id":"ZQo1FZ7mKKxDRbNU","name":"Goblin","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Goblin</h1>\n<p>The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands ofyears. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p>\n<h3>City Goblins</h3>\n<p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

{"_id":"a9hYP0AsSpLRLZNM","name":"Shifter","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Shifter</h1>\n<p>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h3>The Beast Within</h3>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h3>Similiar and Diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Yet to Come</h3>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches} but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Keen Senses: </span>Shifters have heighted senses.

{"_id":"cFcKfGV3ADOOPh4a","name":"Quick Encounters","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Quick Encounters</h1>\n\n  <p>\n    Sometimes the Game Master may want to quickly sum up an encounter rather\n    than track every action round by round. \"Quick Encounters\" resolve these\n    kinds of situations with good collaborative storytelling, tension, and risk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use Quick Encounters when\n    you're pressed for time, the group isn't as interested in tactical fights,\n    or they do something the GM isn't prepared for, like infiltrating an enemy\n    compound she hasn't yet detailed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters make a skill roll based on the type\n    of encounter and their goal and interpret the results narratively with the\n    Game Master.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Encounter Types</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    No @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} are dealt in a Quick Encounter. Instead, the GM describes\n    the scene, and then the players agree on a general plan and what their\n    characters will do to resolve the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once all the players state their intent, they pick the skill that best\n    represents their actions during the encounter and roll. Here are some common\n    examples:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Combat:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill}.</li>\n    <li>\n      <span class=\"list-heading\">Crisis:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} (to calm bystanders), @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair}.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Heist:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery}.</li>\n    <li>\n      <span class=\"list-heading\">Mission:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting},\n      @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Trek:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival}.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Modifiers:</strong> The GM should assign modifiers based on the\n    situation. If the heroes greatly outnumber their opposition, pursue much\n    slower prey, have prior experience with the obstacles in their path, or\n    special equipment to deal with hazards, the roll might be made at +1 to +4.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Very difficult encounters, such as powerful foes (relative to the party),\n    faster prey, or extreme conditions inflict a −1 to −4 penalty.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Turn Order &amp; Critical Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    Players can go in whatever order they want in a Quick Encounter. This might\n    be important if some of their actions are dependent on someone else's. In a\n    heist, for example, the group might depend on a smooth-talker to gather\n    information about the target's security before the thief attempts to break\n    in. Similarly, a battle commander might need to send a scout across enemy\n    lines before sending in a team to sabotage the enemy's war engine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Resolve these kinds of actions in the order that makes sense, and allow\n    those who come after to change their own plans as the situation changes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a critical task is failed, the GM must decide if it stops the encounter\n    or simply complicates it (perhaps inflicting a penalty to everyone else's\n    roll). In the heist example above, for example, maybe the charmer gets the\n    information but tips off someone who adds extra sentries, inflicting a −2\n    penalty to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} rolls. Likewise, the scout might find the war\n    engine's location but the enemy moves the device shortly thereafter, adding\n    the need for additional reconnaissance for the team of saboteurs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These kinds of complications might also mean resolving the encounter in\n    multiple stages instead of one roll as the heroes must react to the changing\n    circumstances (see <strong>Staged Encounters,</strong> below).\n  </p>\n  <h3>Staged Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    Quick Encounters are typically a single die roll followed by some narration\n    between the GM and the players. But some encounters might need additional\n    rounds to better reflect the results or any new information or events that\n    come to light.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the heist to break into a wizard's tower and steal a powerful occult\n    artifact goes badly, for example, the next stage might become a crisis when\n    the tower suddenly bursts into supernatural flames. That might then lead to\n    a combat encounter as an artifact in the wizard's study breaks and releases\n    an angry djinn!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The beauty of staged encounters is their ability to handle complex problems\n    when the constraints of time or larger narrative require a speedy\n    resolution.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Encounter Results</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Once each player has determined her skill and any modifiers, she rolls the\n    dice and works with the Game Master to narrate the details based on the\n    total, the situation, and the other players' actions.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Dangerous Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    If a character fails his roll in a dangerous situation he takes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wound} (or\n    d4 Wounds with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). If he's the driver of a vehicle, it\n    takes a Wound (or d4 with a Critical Failure). Wounds may be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Soak Rolls]{Soaked} as\n    usual.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Success means the hero emerges with only <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} means he escapes unscathed.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Nonlethal Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    If the encounter isn't physically dangerous, failure means the hero doesn't\n    contribute to the party's overall success somehow. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means\n    she suffers social stigma, loses or breaks a piece of vital equipment, is\n    positively identified, or gets the wrong information. This likely means\n    moving on to a second stage of the encounter as she deals with the fallout\n    of her errors.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Success &amp; Failure</h3>\n  <p>\n    In general, narration and individual actions determine the success or\n    failure of an encounter. If the smooth-talker can't learn the habits of the\n    sentries, for example, and the GM decides this fact shuts down the operation\n    rather than complicating it, the encounter fails. In other words, let the\n    story tell the tale.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In a more dynamic situation such as combat, assume the group \"wins\" if there\n    are at least as many total successes (one for each success and raise) as\n    there are player characters. They get the information, drive off their foes,\n    complete the mission, or avert (or escape) the crisis. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} rolls\n    <em>don't</em> count as successes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If there are fewer successes than player characters, they fail. Specifics\n    are up to the Game Master, but this might mean the party has to fall back or\n    retreat from their foes, their prey escapes, they don't get the object or\n    information they sought, they survive the crisis but can't save most of the\n    bystanders, and so on.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If they can try again, the GM should \"reset\" the encounter with the new\n    narrative so the group has to come up with a new plan. And of course, their\n    foes are likely on to them now!\n  </p>\n  <h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3>\n  <p>\n    Use the rules for <strong>Ammo &amp; Power Points</strong> under <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mass Battles]{Mass Battles}</strong> for combat encounters if desired.  Otherwise the player and GM can just decide what resources were consumed in the encounter.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"example\">Example: Night on the prowl</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Our heroes must break into a nobleman's library, steal an ancient book, and stop an evil conspiracy that threatens all of Eberron.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The group decides to play out the break-in as a Quick Encounter. The rogue\n    plans to use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to break into the library, take the manuscript, then\n    escape out the back. The bard supports her with a diversionary recital in the town square.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM decides the rogue's Thievery roll is at −2 to get into the library.\n    The bard gets a success with his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}. He adds +1 to his\n    friend's roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The rogue manages a single success, but since there are two player characters and the rules say they need at least as many successes as there are characters, they fail.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM says three of the nobleman's guards are alerted by the pair's\n    actions. The heroes can continue if they want, but the encounter is now more\n    difficult (−2). The GM also says it's now a Dangerous Encounter as the\n    guards are armed and nervous.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With the fate of Eberron at stake, the party agrees to press on. The rogue\n    now uses @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} to avoid the guards. The bard disguises himself and knocks\n    on the door, pretending to be lost! The GM tells the bard to use Performance\n    for this Support roll. He rolls a 21! Both characters are successful, so the\n    ancient manuscript is secured!\n  </p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_czmcjlz6r8u","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

/>\n<h2>Playing those with Innate Magic</h2>\n<p>Those with innate magic, create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories—just raw power that they direct at will. Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.</p>\n<h3>Raw Magic</h3>\n<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or ataste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So toa might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the [nner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>\n<p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on. nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>\n<h2>CASTING</h2>\n<p>Sorcerers must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Wielding magic that is innate and from some untold force, sorcerers can wield very versatile magic.

{"_id":"g7RNkaHkm0Mh8rdF","name":"Tiefling","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Tiefling</h1>\n<p>Many tieflings are born to the Carrion Tribes, the barbarians who live in the Demon Wastes. Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p>\n<p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}n mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p>\n<h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>\n<p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p>\n<p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</span> Tieflings infernal heritage allows them to see into the darkness of Khyber.

{"_id":"k9CdNhNVMJamIJ1l","name":"Fixed Glory Awards","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Fixed Glory Awards</h1>\n<p>Fixed Glory awards cover lesser deeds not played out (such as events during long periods of downtime), killing smaller number of foes during an adventure (they do slowly add up over time), or rewards for which there are many witnesses (battles or rescues). These are in addition to any Glory gained above.</p>\n<p>GM's are encouraged to devise their own modifiers for things like concluding peace treaties or founding new mercantile routes that benefit a large population. Although notable deeds, the rewards for these types of endeavor should not be overly high—few people will remember who signed a peace treaty, but you can bet they'll recall a hero who risked his life to venture into the heavily guarded camp of the enemy commander and kill him in an epic duel.</p>\n<h2>ACHIEVE RANK</h2>\n<p>Even without performing major heroic deeds, a hero can become famous through his collective lesser deeds. Such rewards are typical of the examples above, especially the slaying of lesser foes.</p>\n<p>These are wrapped into a single +5 Glory bonus gained when a hero achieves a new Rank. It is possible, though rare, for a hero to reach Legendary status with no additional Glory—he has performed many deeds, but none stand out as truly heroic.</p>\n<h2>Mass Battles</h2>\n<p>War is a terrible thing and something sane men avoid, but it can also grow and break reputations.</p>\n<p>Use the table below whenever the characters are involved in a fight using the Mass Battle rules. Whereas skirmishes are commonplace, true mass battles remain rare events. Hence, all Glory modifiers are fixed.</p>\n<table class=\"centered\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Glory for Mass Battles</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Reason</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading centered\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Size</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had hundreds of troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had thousands of troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had more than 10,000 troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Enemy</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Hated rival of your nation</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+/–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Undead Army</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+/–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Victory</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had less tokens or was equal</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token the enemy had above yours</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Defeat</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had more tokens or was equal</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token less your enemy had</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">–3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Personal heroics</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Two raises on Heroes in Mass Battles rolls</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Commander</span></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">You commanded the army</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Character Roll:</strong> Scoring a double raise is more than just a die result. It represents a major event within a battle, such as slaying an enemy commander or slaughtering so many foes a battalion breaks.</p>\n<p>However, the modifier only applies if the number of enemy tokens was less than or equal to your army's tokens at the time (slaying an enemy commander when you have a +3 bonus is nowhere near as heroic as when you have a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Commander: </strong>A hero who commands an army gains greater Glory than his troops for victory, but also suffers more ignominy if he loses the field. Take the final Glory modifier and double it to see what the hero earned.</p>\n<p><strong>Defeat:</strong> Defeat is never easy to live with, but the ignominy is far worse if you outnumbered your foe. For each token you outnumbered your enemy at the start of a battle you suffer a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Forces: </strong>Certain races are more despised than others. To qualify for the bonus, the specific enemy must account for more than 75% of the enemy army's troop strength.</p>\n<p>Add the modifier if the heroes won, and subtract it if they lost (a defeat by a hated foe usually means the enemy will grow more confident and thus pose a greater danger in the future).</p>\n<p><strong>Size: </strong>Huge armies are rare in Khorvaire now the Last War is over, and thus while any battle earns Glory, the more participants there are the greater the tale told.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory: </strong>Everybody loves a winner. The greater the size of the enemy army, the more reward is earned. For each token your enemy's army was larger than yours when battle commenced, the hero earns a +2 Glory bonus.</p>\n<h2>RESCUE</h2>\n<p>Even if the heroes' tale of how they killed a hundred orcs doesn't earn them any immediate Glory, having prisoners recount the tale of their rescue quickly causes word to spread.</p>\n<p>Important NPCs must be famous, powerful, and named. A merchant, wizard, priest, minor noble, or similar is worth +1 Glory. Saving a count or a skilled spellcaster is worth +3. Rescuing a prince, king, or truly powerful spellcaster gains the hero +5 Glory.</p>\n<p>For groups of lesser NPCs, rescuing ten or so is worth +1 Glory, a few tens +2, and a hundred or more +3. Saving a lone villager from an orc tribe is brave, but not enough to be retold by skalds.</p>\n<p>Rescue doesn't have to mean entering a prison and breaking captives out. Liberating a village beset by frostreavers, for instance, counts as a rescue. If the rescue involves a Mass Battle rather than tabletop action, the party is deserving of the Mass Battle rewards as well.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Glory Keywords</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_fvupcu3nvj6","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"kWHJEFh7DxJAkBCl","name":"Bugbear","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Bugbear</h1>\n<p>The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands ofyears. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p>\n<h3>The Marguul</h3>\n<p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p>\n<p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

{"_id":"l9Vbho8CrcdQyi0w","name":"Halfling","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Halfling</h1>\n<p>The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p>\n<h3>Talenta Halflings</h3>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p>\n<h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p>\n<p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Athletic: </span>Halflings are nimble beings.

{"_id":"oOzsARoVgTyjKm2R","name":"Gnome","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Gnome</h1>\n<p>The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Diminutive:</span> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Gnome Magic]{Gnome Magic}: </span>Gnomes are inherently magical creatures.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

The device can only use the powers and Power Points allocated to it.</p>\n<p>Power Points invested in an arcane device are lost to the inventor until they’re used or recovered with <strong>Tinkering</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}:</strong> A user may spend a device’s Power Points as desired, including enabling any applicable @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}.</p>\n<p>Arcane devices may not be <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shorting]{Shorted}</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Limitations]:</strong> Arcane devices may benefit from <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Limitations]{Limitations}</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Activation]{Activation}:</strong> The creator uses his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} as usual. Others use whatever skill is associated with the device’s form— bows use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, knives use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} (throwing), and so on. If there is no other obvious skill, such as for a potion or worn item, the character rolls the inventor’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} as if it were his own (he does <em>not</em> benefit from any of the creator’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} or other abilities, however).</p>\n<p>Failure to activate the device costs one of the device's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Point}, and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} causes the user @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<p><strong>Tinkering:</strong> A creator can reassign up to five @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} per action between an arcane device and her own pool. She must be in physical contact with the item to do so. Characters should lend out their devices very carefully!</p>\n<h2 class=\"example\">Arcane Device Examples</h2>\n<p>A powerful vizier makes an <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Invisibility]{invisibility}</em> cloak and gives it to one of his spies. He has 20 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} and puts 5 of them into the cloak, reducing his remaining pool to 15.</p>\n<p>When the spy wants to turn <em>invisible</em>, she rolls the vizier’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting} skill. This costs 1 less Power Point than usual because of the cloak’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Limitations]{Limitation}— it must be worn to activate so it has a Range of Touch.</p>\n<p>The vizier also gives the spy the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em> power in the form of a wand and invests it with 10 Power Points. The spy rolls @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} to activate the wand.</p>\n<p>The spy suffers @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} if she rolls a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} activating either device.</p>\n<p>Once the cloak or wand is out of energy, the vizier can recover the Power Points he invested in it normally.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ezren the wizard makes an “oil of sharpness” for Valeros the fighter. When rubbed on a sword it activates the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Smite]{smite}</em> power. Ezren invests four Power Points into it. The pair soon find themselves in battle with the undead. Valeros rubs the oil on the blade and rolls Ezren's Spellcasting. The roll fails, which drains the oil of one Power Point. Next turn, Valeros tries again, getting a raise and granting the sword +4 damage. <em>Smite</em> normally costs 2 Power Points but Ezren's Trapping has the Range Limitation so it only costs 1 point for each application.

{"_id":"r8hhOKFEW2sf4V7O","name":"Dwarf","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Dwarf</h1>\n<p>The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

They also add 2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} rolls also related to stonework or mechanical work.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Tough:</span> Dwarves are stout and tough.

There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Mages must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper.

After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p>\n<p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory—villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p>\n<p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Everything living eventually dies. However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p>\n<p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend—it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Eberron.</p>\n<p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Eberron and the more benefits he gains.</p>\n<p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p>\n<h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3>\n<p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory.</p>\n<h2>Gaining Glory</h2>\n<p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p>\n<p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory and Infamy] Keywords</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</p>\n</div>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Setting Rules] Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Born A Hero]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Born from War]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Conviction]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Creative Combat]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dumb Luck]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dynamic Backlash]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fanatics]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fast Healing]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory and Infamy]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Gritty Damage]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hard Choices]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Heroes Never Die]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.High Adventure]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.More Skill Points]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.No Power Points]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Unarmored Hero]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wound Cap]</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":7},"cf":{"id":"temp_zcw12kzdfjm","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"ss1fIoGGw4KMULot","name":"Changeling","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Changeling</h1>\n<p>Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>A Hidden People</h3>\n<p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p>\n<p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p>\n<p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p>\n<h3>Masks and Personas</h3>\n<p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>\n<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

technology. Spellcasters specialize in certain forms of that technology, while artificers tinker with its fundamental workings. Artificers understand magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing facility with magic items and constructs, and in many ways, they keep the magical world of Eberron running.</p>\n<p>Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.</p>\n<h3>ARCANE SCIENCE</h3>\n<p>In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.</p>\n<p>During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations.</p>\n<h3>SEEKERS OF NEW LORE</h3>\n<p>Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.</p>\n<p>This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Artificers craft, invent, and tinker with their inventions. All your powers are produced by inventions that are crafted using various tools. When creating an artificer, pick at least one kind of tool set that the artificer works with; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies} for potions and ungents, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools} for general tinkering, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Warforged Repair Kit]{warforged repair kit} if they work strictly with warforged, or another artisan tool kit that makes sense.</p>\n<p>In general, it's assumed an artificer is constantly working and tinker on their inventions during downtime. Perhaps before bed, in the morning, or during meals. It should be assumed the inventor takes at least an hour a day preparing items that might be used. If the artificer can't perform this tinkering, or does not have their tools, she can't use her powers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Burst]{burst}</em> with a poison effect, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.</p>\n<p>Artificers take pride in their custom inventions, often giving them creative names to differentiate them from other artificers. Such as \"Elenna's Miraculous Healing Ungent\" or \"Mending Spider\". You should make sure to do the same for your powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9jz568pflw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

After all, when you've already slain a giant, who cares if you killed an orc chieftain?</p>\n<p><strong>Foes' Toughness:</strong> Once you start talking about fighting a giant, listeners tend to forget or lose interest in the orcs you defeated in an earlier encounter. As such, only the highest @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness} of defeated foes counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Named Wild Card:</strong> No one really cares much if a hero slays a generic orc chieftain, but the slaying of Nargal the Terrible is a notable deed. Not every @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} should, or indeed can, be named. Sometimes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} orc chief is just a nameless foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Foes:</strong> As with foes' @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}, once you begin telling how the party slew a dozen orcs in one encounter, talk of beating five or six tends to become dull to the average listener. As such, only record the greatest number of foes slain in a single encounter. Defeating three orcs in one room and eight in another equates to only eight orcs.</p>\n<p>The party size includes any allies on the heroes' side—a party with 20 members must defeat a lot of foes at once to get noticed. Even if the heroes forget to mention their helpers, any survivors will be telling their own stories across Rassilon.</p>\n<p><strong>Single Blow:</strong> A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} killed in a single blow must have been unwounded when the killing blow was delivered. Chopping the head off a dread liche with 3 wounds is not exactly heroic.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the foe must have been aware of the party and capable of retaliation—slaughtering sleeping dragons or <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangled}</em> giants doesn't make a good story, though the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> spell might be worth a small bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Storyteller:</strong> Although anyone can tell a story, skalds are trained in using the right words and adjusting the rhythm to keep an audience enthralled. They can turn even a mundane adventure into an epic struggle.</p>\n<h3>GLORY AWARDS</h3>\n<p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p>\n<p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack–damage\" routine.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p>\n<p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a –3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory and Infamy] Keywords</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_fvupcu3nvj6","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onator]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a cleric simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the cleric has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for providing taxes and military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. It was acknowledged that all power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. Throughout Galifar, the nobility remained the foundation of the united kingdom. Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service. Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the nobles didn't administer justice, but it was their duty to maintain the system, appointing justices and maintaining the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and as life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, it remained the case that the majority of property was associated with a noble's domain, and that it was the local lord who appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to the count, the count to their duke, the duke to the prince, the prince to the king.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Common Knowledge, Intimidation, Persuasion, Traditions</li>\n<li><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Aristocract, Charismatic, House Scion, Rich, Filthy Rich</li>\n<li><strong>Social Edges:</strong> Connections</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.zds95QdTAYavucmH"},"cf":{"id":"temp_czl83yuvxcp","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

Remember that no @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Trait} may be raised above its maximum (usually d12 unless modified by an ancestral ability, Edge, etc).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Attribute:</span> Increase one attribute one die type. This option may be taken only once per Rank. Legendary characters may raise an attribute no more than every fourth Advance, up to the ancestral or class maximum.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Skills:</span> Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute one die type;<br />OR increase two skills that are lower than their linked attributes by one die type each (including new skills the character didn’t have before at d4). You cannot increase the same skill twice with the same Advance.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Edge:</span> Gain a new Edge. You should have a story-based reason to take a Background or a core @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{Class Edge}. You can’t become a barbarian overnight, after all. Gaining these @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} should usually take years or some dramatic change in the character’s life, and should only be done with the Game Master’s permission. Core Class Edges and core @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{Prestige Edges} are also limited to one per Rank. Legendary characters may choose a core Class Edge (or Prestige Edge) no more than every fourth Advance.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Buy Off a Hindrance:</span> Permanently remove a Minor @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrance}, or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). The player and GM should work out how and when this happens. Perhaps the shocking death of an ally triggers a change in attitude, the hero puts real effort into improving harmful behavior, or seeks professional help during @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Downtime]{Downtime}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rank</h2>\n<p>“Ranks” reflect a character’s competence and experience. They provide balance between players and grant access to more powerful abilities as one “Advances.” A character begins at Novice Rank and works upward from there. Advances are given out after one or more game sessions. The GM has more detailed information in the Advancement section @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{here}.</p>\n<p>Only player characters use Ranks— Game Master-controlled characters and creatures don’t (we’ll tell you more about this later).</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Rank</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading centered\">Advances</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading centered\">Rank</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">0–3</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">Novice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">4–7</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">Seasoned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">8–11</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">Veteran</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">12–15</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">Heroic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">16+</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">Legendary</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Starting With Experienced Characters</h3>\n<p>If the Game Master wants to start a game with more experienced characters, or you're making a replacement for a fallen hero, you should still make a Novice starting profile and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advance} it from there. This ensures characters are balanced just as if they had gained experience normally.</p>\n<p>Additional goods, equipment, or other assets must be determined by the Game Master. As a quick rule of thumb, Seasoned heroes have 10,000 gold pieces worth of goods and magic items, Veteran characters get 40,000, Heroic 150,000, and Legendary 500,000.</p>\n<h2>Advancement Pace</h2>\n<p>How fast characters Advance in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> depends on the campaign.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Official Adventure Paths:</span> These epic tales tell the Game Master when to give the party an Advance. They typically start at Novice Rank and end at Legendary+, spreading improvements along as the story advances to different stages.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Short Campaigns:</span> If you’re running a campaign of your own creation and expect it to last 10 sessions or less, we recommend giving characters an Advance after each session.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Long Campaigns:</span> Grant an Advance after every two or three sessions for a long campaign, slowing it down to every four or five sessions once the heroes hit Heroic Rank.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Milestone Campaigns:</span> Grant an Advance after certain objectives are met in the campaign. You can grant Advances a bit more often in the early stages, slowing things down in the middle and later chapters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Allies &amp; Advancement</h2>\n<p>Followers and other allies who stay with the party for extended periods can improve their abilities as well.</p>\n<p>If the party advances and the Game Master feels the allies have played a significant role in the story, they Advance as well. This gives player characters a group of loyal retainers and hirelings to interact with and deepens immersion.</p>\n<p>You’ll find an Ally Sheet on our website the group can fill in and use to keep up with their retainers' profile, gear, history, and other notes.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_hcn0cv9pqw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

Successful oratory can topple nations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Most social exchanges are a simple\n    skill roll resisted by the appropriate Trait, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} or\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} vs. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Sprit}. For longer interactions, such as the back and forth\n    of a long argument, negotiation, or a legal proceeding, the following system\n    adds some drama and structure to each side's discussion. (The GM might use a\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task} instead if the argument must be won in a hurry!)\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters make arguments back and forth over\n    three rounds, roll their appropriate skills, then consult the\n    <strong>Conflict Results</strong> table (below) to see how well they've\n    influenced their audience.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Conflict Rounds</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The conflict is broken down into three rounds of conversation, each focusing\n    on a particular point (or a few highly connected points).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    During each round, the player roleplays her character's argument and makes a\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll opposed by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} of whoever she's trying to convince.\n    If a rival argues against her, the roll is opposed by his Persuasion instead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each success and raise by the petitioner grants her an \"Influence Token\"\n    (rivals don't gain tokens, they just oppose the petitioner and keep her from\n    gaining them).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Modifiers:</strong> Persuasion rolls should be modified by the\n    situation as the GM sees fit. A hero trying to convince a wizard of a fact\n    within his field rolls the lowest of his Persuasion or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Occult]{Occult}. A\n    particularly brilliant argument or impassioned roleplaying might add +1 to\n    +4. An insult or <em>faux pas</em> inflicts a similar penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Hindrances should also be considered. Convincing a jury that an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Outsider]{Outsider\n    (Major)} is innocent of a crime, for example, might inflict a −2 penalty.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Results</h3>\n  <p>\n    At the end of the third round, the speaker looks up her total Influence\n    Tokens on the <strong>Social Conflict Results</strong> table below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Trials:</strong> Run trials and similar conflicts from the accuser's\n    point of view since they must usually prove the accused's guilt. If the\n    player characters are the defenders, they oppose the prosecution and must\n    keep them from gaining Influence Tokens with the judge (baron, king,\n    warlord, etc.).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Accusers in a trial must get at least three tokens to convict. Lesser or\n    greater results indicate the degree of punishment based on local customs and\n    laws.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Example: To Arms!</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The cleric must convince a baron to send troops to the defense of a\n    neighboring fiefdom. The barony has warred with his neighbor for generations\n    so the GM decides that's a −4 penalty to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Worse, she's opposed by his slimy wizard, who argues against the idea every round (he opposes her Persuasion rolls).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The cleric gets lucky the first round and gets a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise}. That's two Influence\n    Tokens. She fails on the second, but gets another raise in the third, for a total of four tokens.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The baron agrees but requires payment in land from his neighbor in return for sending part of his army to his rival's defense.\n  </p>\n\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col style=\"width:15%\"></col>\n      <col style=\"width:85%\"></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Social Conflict Results</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Tokens</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Results</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>0</td>\n        <td>\n          Pleas are denied and negotiations fail.

Test is the opposite— it lets him make things more difficult for his foes! Tests include embarrassing an opponent, throwing sand in his eyes, staring him down with a steely gaze, or anything else a clever player can think of to rattle his enemy and put him off-balance.</p>\n<p>To perform a Test, the player describes the action and works with the GM to determine the most appropriate skill to roll for it. Tests are resisted instinctively, so the “attacker’s” skill roll is opposed by the attribute it’s linked to. Tripping someone is an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll versus @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} since that’s what @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} is linked to. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} is linked to Spirit, so verbally humiliating someone is resisted by that attribute. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, when used as a Test instead of an actual attack, isn’t compared to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}— it’s opposed by Agility. Whatever skill is used, performing a Test is an action.</p>\n<p>If the attacker wins the opposed roll, he can choose to make his foe <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Distracted and Vulnerable]{Distracted or ­Vulnerable}</strong>. If he wins with a raise, the target is also @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}, and there may be other subjective effects as the GM allows, such as a tripped foe being knocked @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Prone]{prone}.</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> The GM must determine which modifiers apply to a Test. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, for example, should include @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Range]{Range}, \"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]{Illumination}, etc. A hero with a bonus to his Parry does <em>not</em> add it to his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} when challenged with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Fighting} roll, however, because the defender resists with Agility— not his Parry.</p>\n<p>Take the details into consideration as well— using a shameful secret to hit a rival’s ego where it hurts, for example, might be worth a +2 bonus to the attacker.</p>\n<p><strong>Repetition:</strong> Using the same or similar action repeatedly quickly grows less effective, so the GM shouldn't allow players to use the same tactics, insults, or threats more than once an encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Dice:</strong> If characters have addi­tional dice for a Test, such as when using a weapon with a high Rate of Fire, he may roll all the dice but takes only the highest as his Test total. He doesn’t get multiple results and he can’t spread them out to other targets.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n<h1>Dungeoneering</h1>\n<p>When heroes delve into dungeons— or ruins or even buildings— combat can get cramped.</p>\n<p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, creative use of these <strong>Situational Rules</strong> give the characters options during combat. Instead of just waiting for your turn to get through a door and attack, for example, your hero can attempt other actions to make an impact with teamwork.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Support:</strong> Coordinate your actions and use Support to ensure success. For example, the paladin tries to Push past an ogre blocking the entrance to the villain’s chamber, hoping to create space for the fighter. The rogue rolls Support using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}(“Is that all you got?”) to assist with the paladin’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Push]{Push} attempt.</li>\n<li><strong>Test:</strong> Coordinate tactics to make it harder for enemies to fight back. In the Push example above, the sorcerer— who wants to save @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} for attacks on the villain— can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Test} the ogre with Taunt. Knowing it speaks Giant, she shouts insults in that tongue. If she succeeds on the opposed roll, she makes the ogre @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Distracted and Vulnerable]{Distracted}, which helps the paladin win the opposed Push.</li>\n</ul>\n</aside>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Situational Rules]{Situational Rules} Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aim]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Area Effect Attacks]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Called Shots]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Chases]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Cover and Obstacles]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Defend]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Desperate Attack]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Disarm]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Distracted and Vulnerable]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Evasion]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Finishing Move]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Firing Into Melee]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Attacks]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ganging Up]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Grappling]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hold]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Improvised Weapons]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Innocent Bystandards]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mounted Combat]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Natural Weapons]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Nonlethal Damage]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Off-Hand Attacks]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Prone]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Push]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranged Weapons in Melee]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rate of Fire]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Readying Weapons]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reloading]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Stunned]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Surprise]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Drop]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Touch Attack]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Two Weapons]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Unarmed Defender]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Unstable Platform]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Vehicles]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Attack]</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Withdrawing From Melee]</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_m0zzxp52aw8","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/3.

psionics is the art of tapping the mind’s potential. A psionic character is blessed with a form of innate ability that enables him or her to use mental power to achieve goals or perform tasks that nonpsionic characters can accomplish—if they’re even capable of doing them at all—only by using gross physical skills such as brute strength or raw agility, or by using intellect or force of will distinct from the natural power of the mind itself.</p>\n<p>Your character’s mind is an infinite metaphorical plane, where all things are possible. It may be that all characters have within them the potential for harnessing the energy of the mind, but only those who succeed in tapping into that potential can become psionic characters. A psionic character knows the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of thought and energy. Knowing the path, the psionic character walks it. Like a flare being thrown off a star, a power is manifested from a psionic character’s energy of consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Secrets of the Mind</h3>\n<p>From the duergar traditions of the Akiak dwarves to the quori techniques of the kalashtar and Inspired, psionics are strong in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}. Adventurers might have no recourse but to travel to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} to learn certain psionic arts. The traditions of the psychic warrior are begining to find their way to Khorvaire, but it is still very rare.</p>\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Psionic powers spring from sentient minds and are manifested through intense concentration. The psion merely needs to concentrate to manifest his inborn powers, drawing on his abilities by tapping a reservoir of mental strength. He has no need for messy material components, verbal cues, or awkward gestures.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>TRappings of psionic power are wide and varied. They can draw fire from thin air, move a boulder without touching it, catch a glimpse of the future, and communicate with others who are miles away. Force is a common trapping for psionic powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_9jz568pflw","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.
