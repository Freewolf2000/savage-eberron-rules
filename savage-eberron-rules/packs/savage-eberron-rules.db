Some are rare, possibly one-of-a-kind relics sought after by great heroes and nefarious evils. Others are relatively common items sold in city markets, found in monster lairs, or wielded by enemies. Such magical treasures are a boon to all Pathfinders as they quest across the wild lands of Eberron. </p>\n\t\t\t<h1 class=\"wide\">Using magic items</h1>\n\t\t\t<p>Each type of item on the following pages tells you how it’s used, but there are a few common rules between them:</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Active Powers are Actions:</span> An item that requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} is an action unless it says otherwise. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means the user takes @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} (and loses a charge if the item has them).</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Edges and Abilities:</span> If an item grants an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edge} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Special Abilities]{Monstrous Ability} and the wielder already has that Edge, it grants the improved version (if there is one).</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Minor &amp; Major Powers:</span> Some items grant minor or major powers using the powers listed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{here}. A minor power automatically activates with the effect of a standard success, and a major power activates with the effect of a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} (no Trait roll is made). Unless the item says otherwise, this is an action and the effect lasts for the power’s full Duration and cannot be maintained.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Stacking:</span> If two sources would increase a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Trait}, use only the highest modifier (effects don’t stack). Increases to a Trait from a magic item’s effects don’t count for determining @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Advancement]{Trait Advancements}. They do affect secondary statistics like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry} or Toughness, however. </li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Multiple items:</span> a character can only wear one magic item in each location (head, eyes, shoulders, neck, chest, belt, wrists, hands, feet). Putting on a second necklace or a second belt, for example, has no effect. The exception to this rule is rings. A character can wear two rings and benefit from both magical effects.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<h3>Enemies with Magic Items</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Enemy characters and monsters equipped with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Enchantments]{enchanted} and magical items have the bonuses conferred by those items built into their profiles.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>An evil knight wearing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Heavy Breastplate]{plate armor} enchanted with the Aegis enchantment, for example, might have a Toughness of 12(5), where the plate armor's bonus of +4 has already been increased by the Aegis enchantment's +1.</p>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/andoran-cover.webp\" />\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<h2>Purchasing Magic Items</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Most towns have an apothecary shop with a few potions for sale, a few local merchants reselling magical items, or even individuals looking to sell off devices they no longer need. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>When the adventurers want to buy magic items, roll on the table below to see what's available that week (or month if it's a particularly isolated or low-magic area).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The table has three entries:</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Potions &amp; Scrolls:</strong> Half the items are potions and half are scrolls, rounding in favor of potions.

This is in addition to any healing offered by local clerics or healers (prices for a cleric's services are equivalent to potions of <em>healing</em>).</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Other Items:</strong> This tells you how many other magical treasures may be found or purchased in the settlement. If the result is positive, roll on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Other Item Categories]{Other Item} table to determine the category, then roll on the appropriate subtable.

{"_id":"0lSq3KH2QDfGZ0Ls","name":"Mass Battles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Mass battles</h1>\n  <p>\n    Many adventures feature heroes traveling about the land, gathering @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Allies]{allies} to\n    thwart some inevitable foe or ravaging horde. They build coalitions, train\n    armies, discover powerful artifacts, and finally stand against the enemy in\n    desperate and glorious battle.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The rules presented here allow the Game Master to handle a small warband\n    holding a fort against an undead horde, a siege against a walled city, or\n    even full divisions of troops fighting across a massive battlefield. The\n    process is abstract, but it provides a narrative base for heroes to plan,\n    get involved, and take part in the carnage!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the Mass Battle rules when you\n    need to resolve a large conflict that can go either way, and also allow the\n    player characters to have a role in its outcome. The culmination of these\n    tales is not always a foregone conclusion, and failure can be just as\n    interesting as victory!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Each side has a number of “Force Tokens” equal\n    to its relative strength and size. Commanders roll their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} skill each\n    turn. The winner reduces his rival’s force until one side or the other\n    breaks.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Setup</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    To start, give the larger or more powerful army 10 Force Tokens. Give the\n    opposing army a proportional number of tokens. If one army has 10,000\n    warriors, for example, and the other has 7,000, give the smaller army seven\n    tokens. These represent the troops, ships, and other assets in each side’s\n    army.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Adjust the ratio as makes sense to account for special or elite troops,\n    better equipment, and so on. If one army is half as powerful as another, for\n    example, give one side 10 Force Tokens and the other five. Get close enough\n    to give a reasonable approximation of relative strength. The dice and the\n    players’ actions will handle the rest.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Battle</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    At the start of each round, the player characters discuss and decide on\n    their plan. Then the attackers make an opposed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} roll against the\n    defender. Add the modifiers below as appropriate to each roll.\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Battle Modifiers</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Circumstance</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+1 per<br />point of<br />advantage</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Force Bonus:</strong> The side with the most Force Tokens\n            adds +1 for each point of difference.

Casualties are\n    generally distributed evenly throughout the army or however the GM feels is\n    most appropriate for the narrative.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Time:</strong> A standard battle round is two hours of hard\n    fighting. The Game Master should change this as suits her needs or the\n    story. A more reserved fight might have four- or even eight-hour rounds,\n    while a siege might be a battle round per day.\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Battle Results</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Result</th>\n      </tr>\n      \n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Tie</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>Draw:</strong> Both sides lose one Force Token.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Success</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Marginal Victory:</strong> The victor loses one Force Token, the defeated loses two.\n          </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>Raise</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Victory:</strong> The defeated army loses two Force Tokens.\n          </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <h3>Morale</h3>\n  <p>\n    After an army loses one or more Force Tokens, its leader makes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{Spirit} check modified by these circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <table style=\"width:75%\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Morale Modifiers</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">Circumstance</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>−1</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>Each Force Token lost so far.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army is made up mostly of @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Undead]{undead} or other @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Fearless]{fearless} troops.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army is within fortifications or prepared positions.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>+2</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>The army cannot retreat or will be killed if it does.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <p>\n    Success means the leader cajoles the army to fight on.

troubadours, song mages, are sorcerers who work their magic through the power of motion, song, poetry, and storytelling. The art is extremely ancient and found among all races, though the dragonmarked House Phiarlan maintains the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, and it has dominated the industry for centuries. The house trains and licenses performers, and maintains many of the grand stages. The finest schools of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} are known as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Five Demesnes}. As well as being spellcasters, bards are also storytellers and poets, able to recount epic poems and stories from memory. Some play instruments, but most simply use their voice to enthrall their audience. Their talents make them popular guests. Finding a warm place to sleep and a hot meal usually requires nothing more than a tale to entertain the host.</p>\n<p>From the ancient goblin dirge singers to the entertainers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, many cultures embrace the bard or skald as entertainer who also serves as a historian or bearer of news, a chronicler if you will. To survive on the road, a trouper must be clever, charismatic, and versatile above all. Whether a tryst with a foe resolves by silver-tongue or adamantine blade, an adventuring bard's worth truly comes from the ability to improvise a magical talent to charm, lull, or simply assist with a nearly limitless reservoir of practical knowledge and skill. While the common trope sings of a troubadour whose magic harmonizes with some cosmic symphony, those who have traversed Khorvaire have learned that inspiration is the true magic of any bardic exhibition, regardless of the medium.</p>\n<p>Bards usually don’t end up as wandering minstrels or street performers—any expert with some training and skill can fill that role. Instead, some skalds use their magical abilities to unearth ancient lore, while others use their interpersonal skills and mystical music to advance their careers as spies, ambassadors, diplomats, and chroniclers. As such, skalds find employ as adventurers, as well as in governments and among the mercantile houses.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} produces a large number of bards, since the gnomes’ love of knowledge makes them particularly well suited to this class. In other areas, bards appear most often in the large cities and towns throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}, and (particularly) @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Bards with wilder ties are found in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, particularly among the druid sect of the Greensingers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that pervades Eberron: through music. Some bards claim that the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful tune of creation.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for a skald will always manifest as something with the performing arts. Song and sonic trappings would be the most common. But other trappings could include playing an instrument, dancing, a poetic verse, and anything else of the like.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

After all, when you’ve already slain a giant, who cares if you killed an orc chieftain?</p>\n<p><strong>Foes’ Toughness:</strong> Once you start talking about fighting a giant, listeners tend to forget or lose interest in the orcs you defeated in an earlier encounter. As such, only the highest @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness} of defeated foes counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Named Wild Card:</strong> No one really cares much if a hero slays a generic orc chieftain, but the slaying of Nargal the Terrible is a notable deed. Not every @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} should, or indeed can, be named. Sometimes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} orc chief is just a nameless foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Foes:</strong> As with foes’ @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}, once you begin telling how the party slew a dozen orcs in one encounter, talk of beating five or six tends to become dull to the average listener. As such, only record the greatest number of foes slain in a single encounter. Defeating three orcs in one room and eight in another equates to only eight orcs.</p>\n<p>The party size includes any allies on the heroes’ side—a party with 20 members must defeat a lot of foes at once to get noticed. Even if the heroes forget to mention their helpers, any survivors will be telling their own stories across Rassilon.</p>\n<p><strong>Single Blow:</strong> A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} killed in a single blow must have been unwounded when the killing blow was delivered. Chopping the head off a dread liche with 3 wounds is not exactly heroic.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the foe must have been aware of the party and capable of retaliation—slaughtering sleeping dragons or <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangled}</em> giants doesn’t make a good story, though the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> spell might be worth a small bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Storyteller:</strong> Although anyone can tell a story, skalds are trained in using the right words and adjusting the rhythm to keep an audience enthralled. They can turn even a mundane adventure into an epic struggle.</p>\n<h3>GLORY AWARDS</h3>\n<p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p>\n<p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack–damage\" routine.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p>\n<p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a –3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Additional Glory Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_rv4q29jrhjs","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"1OqUkTn0tSLDucmw","name":"Warforged","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Warforged</h1>\n<p>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>\n<h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p>\n<h3>Warforged Personality</h3>\n<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>\n<p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Built for War:</strong> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war. Negotiations were not part of their training, and their world knowledge off of the battlefield is limited. They do not have @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} as core skills.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Composite Plating]{Composite Plating}: </strong>A warforged is covered in tough plating made of magically-treated woods and metals.

They do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Poison]{poison} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Disease]{disease}. Warforged also don’t need to sleep, and arcane powers can’t put them to sleep. Warforged must spend at least six hours in a relaxed state. In this state, they appear inert, but remain conscious, and they can see and hear as normal.\n<p>Wounds must be mended via the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair}</em> power or the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair} skill. Each attempt takes one hour per current @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Damage Effects]{Wound} level and ignores the “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Healing]{Golden Hour}”.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Outsider (Warforged)]{Outsider (Major)}: </strong>With a history of being dedicated soldiers of war, warforged have difficulty blending into post-war Khorvaire. Most non-warforged strongly dislike the sight of warforged as they stand as living reminders of the horror that was the Last War. As such, warforged have –2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{persuasion} rolls when interacting with non-warforged and are often treated with less rights that others.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Specialized Design]{Specialized Design}:</strong> Warforged are typically designed for specific purposes. They start with a d4 in any skill based on their experiences, education, training.

For longer interactions, such as the back and forth\n    of a long argument, negotiation, or a legal proceeding, the following system\n    adds some drama and structure to each side's discussion. (The GM might use a\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Dramatic Tasks]{Dramatic Task} instead if the argument must be won in a hurry!)\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters make arguments back and forth over\n    three rounds, roll their appropriate skills, then consult the\n    <strong>Conflict Results</strong> table (below) to see how well they've\n    influenced their audience.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Conflict Rounds</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The conflict is broken down into three rounds of conversation, each focusing\n    on a particular point (or a few highly connected points).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    During each round, the player roleplays her character's argument and makes a\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll opposed by the Spirit of whoever she's trying to convince.\n    If a rival argues against her, the roll is opposed by his Persuasion instead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each success and raise by the petitioner grants her an \"Influence Token\"\n    (rivals don't gain tokens, they just oppose the petitioner and keep her from\n    gaining them).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Modifiers:</strong> Persuasion rolls should be modified by the\n    situation as the GM sees fit. A hero trying to convince a wizard of a fact\n    within his field rolls the lowest of his Persuasion or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Occult]{Occult}. A\n    particularly brilliant argument or impassioned roleplaying might add +1 to\n    +4. An insult or <em>faux pas</em> inflicts a similar penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Hindrances should also be considered. Convincing a jury that an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Outsider]{Outsider\n    (Major)} is innocent of a crime, for example, might inflict a −2 penalty.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Results</h3>\n  <p>\n    At the end of the third round, the speaker looks up her total Influence\n    Tokens on the <strong>Social Conflict Results</strong> table below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Trials:</strong> Run trials and similar conflicts from the accuser's\n    point of view since they must usually prove the accused's guilt.

Lesser or\n    greater results indicate the degree of punishment based on local customs and\n    laws.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Example: To Arms!</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The cleric must convince a baron to send troops to the defense of a\n    neighboring fiefdom.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using Smarts is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Schools]{Schools}</h3>\n<p>A wizard's intense studies lead him down two paths—a \"universalist\" who dabbles in all the various \"schools\" of magic, or a \"specialist\" who focuses on a school at the expense of other studies.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Specialists</strong></em> designate one favored @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{school} and two opposition @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{schools} from the list below.

He studies them daily, transcribing their mystical patterns onto his mind.</p>\n<p>The link to the book is far more than rote memorization—it is an arcane bond with the power and patterns within. If a wizard doesn’t have access to his spellbook, he may continue to cast normally until the next sunset or sunrise (whichever comes first). After that, the magical imprint on his mind fades and he can no longer cast them.</p>\n<p>Wizards may only carry one active spellbook at a time.

It takes a week of work and 500 gp to create a replacement spellbook once the wizard has access to his magical notes.</p>\n<p>When a wizard finds a new spellbook or scroll, the spells it contains become available as choices to the wizard when he next chooses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers} Edge.

In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, \n            especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn’t distracting the flow of the game), toss the player a Benny. \n            When players roleplay a Hindrance, reward them. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p>\n        <p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, \n            players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the rogue <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. \n            There’s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but the character is the <em>rogue</em> and wants to prove it to the rest of the party.\n        </p>\n        <p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That’s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that \n            got them to this point. <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The “currency” of these chances are \n            those Bennies.\n        </p>\n        <p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded \n            for roleplaying their Hindrances the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they’re gained. That’s a fantastic pace. \n            It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some critical resource management for the final showdown.\n        </p>\n        <p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group.

{"_id":"4FZyw9PdSQ7ZMJW2","name":"Goblin","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Goblin</h1>\n<p>The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands ofyears. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p>\n<h3>City Goblins</h3>\n<p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

{"_id":"5m5M4Xbo2onkFeL3","name":"Languages","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Languages</h1>\n<p>In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language. Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language.

{"_id":"65n5URr0MER6n0yM","name":"Kalashtar","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Kalashtar</h1>\n<p>The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union ofhumanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams-spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p>\n<h3>Bound to Spirits</h3>\n<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p>\n<h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3>\n<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dual Mind: </strong>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

{"_id":"6my6pjbtJ8m0DEef","name":"2 Combat","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <div>\n    <h1 class=\"wide\">Combat</h1>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Whether they’re the burning plains of the Cinderlands or the cursed\n    battlefield of the Plain of Ten Thousand Swords--these are\n    <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> and they are often violent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The rest of this chapter tells you how great heroes and terrible monsters\n    battle in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>. The combat rules are designed for\n    use with miniatures or pawns by default, but it’s easy to use these concepts\n    when you’re playing without them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Distance:</strong> Because the game assumes you are using terrain or\n    a battlemat and standard 28mm miniatures, movement and weapon ranges are\n    listed in inches. To translate that to regular distance, one inch equals two\n    yards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If you’re using miniatures and need to accommodate a larger battlefield,\n    simply set each inch as five or 10 yards, for example, and adjust movement\n    and ranges appropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Time:</strong> When a fight breaks out, game time breaks down into\n    rounds of about six seconds each. Ten rounds equal one minute.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Round:</span> A “round” is an entire countdown of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards}, from\n      the Ace to the Deuce (Two).\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Turn:</span> A character’s “turn” occurs when his Action Card comes\n      up in the countdown. A hero with the Six of Diamonds, for example, takes\n      his turn when that card comes up in the round.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Action:</span> A single attack, skill use, etc. Characters may\n      perform multiple actions on their turn (see <strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong>).\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Action Cards (Initiative)</h2>\n  <p>\n    The action in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is fast and furious. To help\n    the Game Master keep track of who goes in what order and add a little\n    randomness to the game, we use a single deck of playing cards with both\n    Jokers left in to determine everyone’s initiative order. We call these\n    “Action Cards.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM can deal cards face up or face down as she sees fit. She might also\n    deal the players’ cards face up and the villains face down to increase the\n    players’ tension and uncertainty!\n  </p>\n  <p>At the start of each round:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      Deal each @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} an Action Card (plus any extra cards for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges}).\n      Allies under a player’s control act on his Action Card.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Groups of nonplayer characters and creatures, such as all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Zombie, Human]{zombies}, all\n      @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Dog/wolf]{wolves}, and so on, should share an Action Card so they act together. This\n      breaks each group up a bit for dramatic purposes and game balance and\n      keeps things easy for the Game Master to manage.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Shuffle:</strong> Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker\n    was dealt.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Large Groups:</strong> In very large groups or time-sensitive games,\n    the Game Master can deal a single card per side (heroes and villains). On\n    the heroes’ turn, simply start at one end of the group and work quickly\n    around. This speeds things up if that’s more important than varying\n    initiative order. If one or more characters have @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed} or \n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, let\n    that apply to the draw (but only once).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>The Countdown</h3>\n  <p>\n    Once the cards are dealt, the Game Master starts the round by counting down\n    from Ace down to Two, with each group resolving its actions when its card\n    comes up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Ties:</strong> Ties are resolved by suit order: Spades ♠ are first,\n    then Hearts <span class=\"red\">♥</span>, Diamonds <span class=\"red\">♦</span>,\n    and Clubs ♣. That’s reverse alphabetical order as used in many common card\n    games.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Jokers:</span> Characters (or groups) with a Joker act whenever they\n      want in the round, even interrupting another’s action. They also add +2 to\n      all @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{damage} rolls this round!\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Actions</h2>\n  <p>\n    Characters perform “actions” when their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card} comes up each round.\n    This is their “turn.” A character can move (see <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong>,\n    below) and perform one regular action at any point in her movement,\n    attacking, casting a spell, and so on, without penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Characters can choose from a multitude of actions on their turn. Common\n    actions include @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Supporting} allies, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Testing} foes, \n    using a power, or attacking with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}. \n    See <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong> to perform\n    more than one action per turn (though only one of these can be a limited action).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    More complex actions like lighting a torch or digging through a backpack\n    might require more than a round to complete (GM’s call).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Free Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    Speaking a short sentence or two, moving up to the character’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Pace}, falling\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Prone]{prone}, or dropping an item are all free actions. A hero can generally\n    perform several free actions on her turn simultaneously (speaking and\n    dropping an item while walking, for example), though only one of these can\n    be a limited free action (see below). The GM decides how much is too much.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Some free actions occur automatically at the beginning of a character’s turn\n    and may only be tried once, such as recovering from being @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken} or \n    \"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Stunned]{Stunned}.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Free actions that are “reactions,” such as resisting @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Opposed Rolls]{opposed rolls} or\n    powers, occur each time the situation presents itself.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Limited Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    Some actions are so complex or involved they require greater concentration.\n    A character may only perform one limited action on their turn. It may be\n    part of a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action} as usual.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Limited Free Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    A character may only perform one limited free action per turn. For example, the barbarian’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Intimidating Glare]{Intimidating Glare} \n    allows her to make an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} Test as a limited free action. If the barbarian also had access to another limited free action, she could not do it in the same turn \n    as she used Intimidating Glare.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Movement</h2>\n  <p>\n    Characters can move a number of tabletop inches equal to their Pace each turn, and may freely set their facing as they do so.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each inch of movement spent climbing, crawling, or swimming uses 2″ of Pace.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Running:</strong> A hero can “run” as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action} once per turn,\n    increasing her Pace for the round by her running die (a d6 by default) at the cost of a −2 penalty to all other actions that turn. Running dice never\n    Ace. (The running die is random to account for nuances of terrain not depicted on the tabletop and for the “risk to reward” decision players must make.)\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Out of combat situations, a character can move twice the sum of her full Pace + maximum running die for a number of minutes equal to half her Vigor\n    die type. Thus a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Fleet-Footed]{Fleet-Footed} character with Vigor d6 can sprint at a Pace\n    of 32 for three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Difficult Ground:</strong> Each inch a hero moves over rough terrain\n    such as thick forest, up or down a steep incline, slippery ice, etc., counts\n    as 2″ of her Pace. Crawling is unaffected by Difficult Ground.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Hazards:</strong> If the GM feels movement is hazardous for some\n    reason--climbing under duress, swimming a fast-moving river, walking a\n    tightrope--she can require an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll to move. Success means she continues on normally. \n    Failure means she can’t move. With a \"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} the character takes \n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from <strong>Bumps &amp; Bruises</strong>, falls if climbing or in a precarious position \n    (see <strong>Falling</strong>), or drowns if swimming (see <strong>Drowning</strong>) both in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hazards]{Hazards}.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Other Movement Issues</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Jumping:</span> Characters can jump 1″ (two yards) horizontally, or 0.5″ vertically as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action}. \n      Double these numbers if the hero can run at least 2″ (four yards) prior to the jump. If the hero chooses, she may make an \n      @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll as an action to increase her horizontal distance by 1″ (2″ with a raise), or half that vertically. \n      Jumping does not allow a character to exceed her total Pace for the turn.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Prone:</span> A hero may fall @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Prone]{prone} as a free action during her\n      turn. She may crawl while prone (see above). Standing is a free action but\n      reduces total Pace for the turn by 2.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Attacks</h2>\n  <p>\n    The basics of fast, furious combat are discussed below. Many additional options and situations are covered under <strong>Situational Rules</strong> \n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Situational Rules]{here}.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Melee Attacks</h3>\n  <p>\n    The Target Number to hit an opponent is equal to his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry} (2 plus half his\n    Fighting die type; 2 if he has no Fighting skill).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n  <p>\n    The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill covers everything from bows to crossbows and even some\n    magic items that shoot projectiles. Throwing knives, spears, and other thrown projectiles uses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    All ranged weapons have a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Range]{Range} statistic written like this: 5/10/20, or\n    Short/Medium/Long Range.\n  </p>\n\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th colspan=\"2\"><h3>Range penalties</h3></th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th><h4>Range</h4>\n        </th><th><h4>Modifier</h4>\n      </th></tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>Short</p></td>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>—</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>Medium</p></td>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>−2</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>Long</p></td>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>−4</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>Extreme (see notes)</p></td>\n        <td class=\"centered\"><p>−8</p></td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n\n  <p>\n    The base Target Number to hit something at Short Range is 4. Firing at\n    longer ranges inflicts the penalties listed above.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Extreme Range:</strong> Extreme Range is up to 4× a weapon’s Long\n    Range. Firing at such a great distance requires the\n    <strong>Aim</strong> option. When used in this way, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aim]{Aim} doesn’t reduce any\n    penalties--it simply allows the character to fire at Extreme Range.\n  </p>\n  <p>Characters may not throw weapons at Extreme Range.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Rate of Fire:</strong> Rate of Fire is how many shots (Shooting\n    dice) a ranged weapon can fire in one action. A longbow with a RoF of 1, for\n    example, can fire one shot per action. For weapons with a Rate of Fire 2 or\n    more, declare how many shots you are firing. Then roll that number of\n    Shooting dice and assign them in whatever order you like to the chosen\n    targets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} roll their Shooting dice plus a single Wild Die, which can\n    <em>replace</em> any one Shooting die if desired.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Damage</h2>\n  <p>\n    After a successful melee or ranged hit, the attacker rolls damage. Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed in the \n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Gear]{Gear} section. Most bows, for example, cause 2d6 damage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s Strength die plus a second\n    die, which depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long\n    sword (d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage. Add the rolls on the damage dice\n    together to get the damage total.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Even though Strength is used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} so \n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} don’t add a Wild Die to the roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>All damage rolls can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Unarmed Damage:</strong> An unarmed combatant rolls only his Strength die unless he has an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edge} like \n    <strong>\"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Brawler]{Brawler}</strong> that grants him a damage die.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Bonus Damage</h3>\n  <p>\n    Well-placed attacks are more likely to hit vital areas and do more damage. If your hero gets a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} \n    on his attack roll (regardless of how many raises), he adds +1d6 to the final total. Bonus dice can also @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace!}</p>\n  <p>\n    Bonus damage applies to all attacks, including spells and area effect\n    weapons.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Applying Damage</h3>\n  <p>\n    If the damage roll is less than the target’s Toughness, the victim is beaten\n    up a bit but there’s no game effect. If the damage is equal to or greater\n    than his Toughness, he’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}. Each raise on the damage roll also inflicts\n    a Wound:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Success:</span> The character is Shaken. If he was already Shaken and the second\n      result is from physical damage of some kind (not a Test that results in\n      Shaken, for example), he remains and takes a Wound.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Raise:</span> The character suffers a Wound for every raise on the damage roll,\n      and is Shaken.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Damage Effects</h2>\n  <p>Damage can result in three effects: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wounds}, \n    and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitation}.</p>\n\n  <h3>Shaken</h3>\n  <p>\n    Shaken characters are nicked, bruised, or otherwise rattled. They may only\n    take @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free actions}, such as moving (including running). At the start of their\n    turn, Shaken characters must attempt to recover from being Shaken by making\n    a Spirit roll. This is a free action.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Failure:</span> The character remains Shaken. She can only perform free actions.\n    </li>\n    <li>Success: The character is no longer Shaken and may act normally.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Bennies:</strong> A player may spend a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny} at any time to remove\n    her Shaken status (even when it’s not her turn).\n  </p>\n  <h3>Wounds</h3>\n  <p>\n    Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a Wound. Extras are @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated} if\n    they take a single Wound (and aren’t <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Resilient/Very Resilient]{Resilient}</strong>). They’re\n    dead, injured, or otherwise out of the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} can take three Wounds and still function \n    (more with certain @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges} or abilities). Further damage doesn’t cause additional Wounds but Incapacitates them instead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Wound Penalties:</strong> Each Wound a character suffers causes a −1\n    cumulative penalty to his Pace (minimum of 1″) and all @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait rolls}--up to a\n    maximum penalty of −3.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Timing:</strong> Characters sometimes take multi­ple hits on the same @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card}. \n    Resolve each damage roll separately before moving on to the next (including any Soak rolls).\n  </p>\n  <h3>Wound Cap</h3>\n  <p>\n    In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, characters can never suffer more than four @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wounds} \n    in a single hit and therefore never have to Soak more than four wounds either.

{"_id":"6qE8QcidtDghyi0x","name":"Chases and Vehicles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Chases &amp; Vehicles</h1>\n<p>One of the most thrilling staples of adventure film, television, and fiction is the chase. This simple twist on the regular combat rules lets you race muscle cars over blasted deserts, track freestyle runners across concrete jungles, and even recreate desperate dogfights in the sky or the depths of space.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Quick Encounters]{Quick Encounters} rules if you just want to find out if the heroes catch a fleeing foe. If you want more detail, use these rules for highly mobile pursuits too large for the tabletop. You’ll also find rules for resolving damage against vehicles, and what effect it has on their drivers in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Participants vie for position using “Chase Cards” to track relative distance</p>\n<h3>Maneuvering Skills</h3>\n<p>The following rules often call for maneuvering skill rolls. Exactly what skill that is depends on whether the character is on foot, mounted, or in a vehicle of some sort:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Airplane or Spaceship: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting}</li>\n<li><strong>Foot or Bike: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</li>\n<li><strong>Mount or Wagon: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding}</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Driving]{Driving}</li>\n<li><strong>Watercraft: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>The standard results for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critically Failing} a maneuvering roll are listed below, but the GM can always create her own result appropriate to the situation as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Mounted Combat]{Mounted}: </strong>Roll a d6. 1–2: the rider loses his turn; 3–4: his mount suffers @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} (this applies to the animal’s rolls <em>and</em> the rider’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding} rolls); 5–6: the rider suffers Fatigue from a bad bounce, low-hanging obstacle, or overexertion trying to control his animal.</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle: </strong>The operator must roll on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong> table.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking/Running:</strong> Roll a die. Even, he loses the rest of his turn as he stumbles, negotiates an obstacle, or takes a wrong turn. Odd, he suffers @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/FootChase.webp\" />\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>To start a chase, shuffle an extra deck of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} and deal them out in a row on the table (nine is a good number for most chases, add more as needed).</p>\n<p>Now break all the participants into each group that will move and act independently. Everyone in the same ship, boat, or vehicle, for example, is one group. In a foot chase, each player character acts independently because they move independently. The horde of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} chasing them can be broken up into groups as the GM decides.</p>\n<p>The rear-most character or vehicle should be at the rear—on the far left card or “Card 1.” Everyone else should be placed to his right as fits the circumstances. Add more cards to either end of the row if someone falls behind or surges ahead.</p>\n<p>The Range is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker’s card) times the Range Increment, which varies for the type of chase:</p>\n<table class=\"table reverse-value-table\" style=\"width:66%\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Range Increments</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Type</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Increment</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Foot, Mounted, or Vehicular</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Airplane or Sailing Ship</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jets or Starships</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These are <em>suggested</em> ranges based on the weapons typically used in that type of chase. The goal is to give most ranged weapons the ability to fire at a few cards distance and give an advantage to those with longer ranged weapons. Increase or decrease the Range Increment as makes sense for the particular scenario. In a tank battle, for instance, you might want to change the Range Increment to 100, even though it’s a “vehicular” fight.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/ChaseExample.webp\" />\n<h2>Chase Rounds</h2>\n<p>Once all the participants are placed, deal each independent character or group an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card} at the start of each round as usual. They then act in whatever order they choose as their Action Card comes up. This is important so passengers can @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support} their driver before he has to make a critical roll, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test} a foe to make him @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Distracted and Vulnerable]{Vulnerable}, attack <em>before</em> their vehicle changes distance (<em>or</em> after) to take maximum advantage of their weapons, and so on.</p>\n<p>The participants can move along the track using the <strong>Change Position</strong> maneuver (see below), closing on foes, running from them, or attempting to reach some objective.</p>\n<p>The length of each round is up to the GM, but is usually a combat round in a foot or car chase. Battles in space might represent many minutes per round until the action zooms in on a fast-paced dogfight.</p>\n<p><strong>Boarders:</strong> Characters in or on an enemy vehicle get their own Action Card (as a group).</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Speed:</strong> The Game Master must decide who’s allowed to participate in a chase. A kid on a bike might be able to chase bandits in a car if the streets are very congested, but is left behind after a round on the open road.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending the Chase:</strong> A chase ends when one side gets away (disabling all pursuers, the Flee maneuver, etc.) or is forced to stop. Participants can always choose to stop if they want, either dropping out or stopping to engage their enemies.</p>\n<p>A chase might also end after a certain number of rounds or as one or more of those involved reach a certain card along the track. In a <cite>Weird War Two</cite> bombing run, for example, the bombers might need to reach the last card on the track to drop their payload. The fighters scrambling after them must try to stop them before they reach their target.</p>\n<h3>Chase Actions</h3>\n<p>Characters in a chase can do most anything they’d normally do, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support}, use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Powers]{powers}, or make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Attacks]{attacks}. The GM decides how close a character has to be to try a particular action. A defender must be able to see or hear a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Taunt]{Taunt} for it to be effective, for example. If the attacker and defender are connected via audio or video feeds, of course, distance probably won’t matter.</p>\n<p>Nonplayer character crews of ships, starships, and other large vehicles are assumed to be doing their jobs already and shouldn’t roll Support or Tests. Those special actions are the domain of the player characters or named Extras and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards}—including those on the opposing side!</p>\n<p><strong>Held Actions:</strong> A character on Hold may attempt to interrupt enemy actions as usual. In personal combat (including foot chases), the two make opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} rolls. When mounted, it’s opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Riding]{Riding} rolls. In vehicle chases, the GM must decide which skills are most appropriate (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} vs. maneuvering to interrupt the driver, for example).</p>\n<p>If trying to act before an entire vehicle, ship, or group with multiple characters takes its action, the opposed roll should be made against the driver or leader.</p>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Groups</h2>\n<p>Make Group rolls for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} who move and act together. If they have a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} leader, use his skill to make maneuvering rolls and assume his leadership keeps the group together.</p>\n<p>This means @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken} members of a group are dragged along with the rest, and individual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} or other conditions are ignored unless that specific member is targeted, or all the members of the group share the same condition.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>Below are a number of special maneuvers characters can attempt during a chase. Maneuvers may also be part of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}. A driver can Change Position and fire his weapon, for example, or say he attempts a Force if he gets close enough.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Board (Action): </strong>Sailing ships use grappling hooks and planks to pull their prey close and board. Starships might use breaching tubes or assault pods.<br />To board, the attacker and defender must be on the same Chase Card. The two then make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker is successful, the two vessels are joined and his crew may board the enemy craft.<br />If defenders have been designated to repel boarders and weren’t being used for other purposes (such as sailing or crewing stations on a starship), they start on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hold]{Hold} unless the attacker won the boarding roll with a raise.<br />Once a boarding action begins, the com­mander of the boarded vessel can only attempt to Change Position, which is made at −4 if grappling lines, tractor beams, or other restraints are involved. If she’s successful, her vessel is no longer grappled (though some of the boarders may still be on her ship!). With a raise, she breaks free and may move one Chase Card in either direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Change Position (Action or Free Action):</strong> A character or driver may change his position by making a maneuvering roll as a free action. Success allows him to move up or down one Chase Card, and up to two with a raise. The character may also Change Position as an action, adding +2 to his roll. Either way, this maneuver may only be used once per turn.<br /><strong>Speed Bonus:</strong> If a rider, runner, ship, or vehicle’s Top Speed is faster than the fastest of his rivals, he adds +1 to his maneuvering roll to Change Position, or +2 if he’s twice as fast.<br /><strong>Dropping Back:</strong> In a linear chase, a character may drop “back” one or two Chase Cards without making a maneuvering roll. He may not Change Position further, either as an action or a free action.</li>\n<li><strong>Evade (Action or Free Action):</strong> The char­acter or driver zigzags through terrain, maximizes cover, or otherwise concentrates on not getting hit. Melee and ranged attacks against him, his vehicle, or anyone on it suffer a −2 penalty until the start of that vehicle’s next turn. The character and any occupants on his mount or in his vehicle also take the penalty to their attacks as the erratic movement or obstacles affect their targeting and aim as well. If the character performs this maneuver as an action, the penalty increases to −4 (in both directions).<br />Evade may not be taken more than once per round (it does not stack).</li>\n<li><strong>Flee (Action):</strong> A character or vehicle may escape the chase if there are at least four Chase Cards between himself and the closest foe. If so, he makes a maneuvering roll at −4 and escapes if successful. The penalty is reduced to −2 if there are at least five cards between them, and 0 if there are six or more.</li>\n<li><strong>Force (Action):</strong> The attacker attempts to force a rival away from his vehicle or into an obstacle. To do so, both must be on the same Chase Card and make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker wins, he <strong>Bumps</strong> (see below) his foe. A raise is treated as if the defender rolled a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuvering roll (see <strong>Maneuvering Skills</strong>, above).<br />The GM may also allow characters to use other skills, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, to put obstacles in the foe’s path. Critical Failure means the attempt backfires on the attacker!</li>\n<li><strong>Hold Steady (Free Action):</strong> The character, driver, or pilot holds steady to line up a better shot. They ignore the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Unstable Platform]{Unstable Platform} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Running} penalties, but attacks against the vehicle and all its occupants are made at +2 until the beginning of their next turn (this does not stack with Vulnerable).</li>\n<li><strong>Ram (Action):</strong> An attacker can Ram a defender if they’re on the same Chase Card by making opposed maneuvering rolls. If successful, both participants cause the following damage to the other: <br />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scale:</strong> The base damage each being or vehicle causes is based on its Scale: Small (d6), Normal (2d6), Large (3d6), Huge (4d6), and Gargantuan (5d6).</li>\n<li><strong>Raise:</strong> +d6 bonus damage for the attacker if he got a raise on his maneuvering roll. Toughness: +d6 if the vehicle’s Tough­ness is higher than his foe’s; +2d6 if Toughness is twice as high.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Speed]{Speed}:</strong> +d6 to both sides if the attacker’s Top Speed is between 60 and 120 MPH; +2d6 if it’s over 120 MPH.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"bump-aside\">\n<h2>Bump</h2>\n<p>Several circumstances result in a character or group being “Bumped.” The foe who caused the Bump may move the defender one Chase Card in any direction. She may do this at any time during her turn as she chooses (to resolve other attacks first, for example).</p>\n<p>When a target is Bumped by an indirect action (such as a Complication), the opposing side chooses the direction.</p>\n<p>An attacker can’t Bump a particular target more than one space each turn regardless of the source (multiple attacks, the Force maneuver, etc.). Other attackers, even those sharing the same @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card}, may Bump the target separately, however.</p>\n<p>Groups always stay together in a chase, so they’re only moved if their driver or leader is Bumped, or the GM feels it’s narratively appropriate.</p>\n<p>Bumps are only used in chases. Ignore them on the tabletop.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>If a character or group’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card} is a Club, something has gone wrong. An obstacle may block the path, the engine might stall, or a hero might have to run through mud, ice, uphill, or some other impediment.</p>\n<p>The character, driver, or pilot must make a maneuvering roll as a free action to deal with the Complication. The suit on his current Chase Card determines any modifier to the maneuvering roll and the results of failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Action Card</em> triggers the Comp­lication; the <em>Chase Card</em> defines any modifier (Mod) and the result of failure.</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Complications</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Suit</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Mod</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Failure Result</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spades</strong></td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuver­ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hearts</strong></td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diamonds</strong></td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Clubs</strong></td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on a maneuver­ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Joker</strong></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped up to two Chase Cards.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Special Conditions:</strong> GMs can also use Complications to trigger special conditions or hazards of the encounter. For example, trig­gering reinforcements anytime a Diamond Complication occurs, or the first character to fail a Club Complication is hit by lightning during a battle in a fierce storm.</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Characters may make ranged and melee attacks normally, using all their usual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} as usual as long as the GM agrees they make sense in the particular situation.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Melee Attacks:</strong> In foot, mounted, or car chases, characters can make hand-to-hand attacks only if they’re on the same Chase Card. The usual rules, such as the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Ganging Up]{Gang-Up} bonus, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Withdrawing From Melee]{Withdrawing From Melee}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Innocent Bystanders]{Innocent Bystanders}, etc., apply as the GM sees fit.<br />Should anyone want to attack a moving vehicle, its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Parry} is 2+ half the driver’s maneuvering skill, plus its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{Handling}. Attacks aren’t usually possible between very fast vehicles, airplanes, starships, and the like.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Drivers and chara­cters can fire ranged weapons as usual. The @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker’s card) times the Range Increment. Attacks may also target crew if they’re visible (don’t forget any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover} they might have).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Characters/Mounts:</strong> Damage is resolved normally, but if the character (or his mount) is @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Stunned]{Stunned}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounded} in a chase, he’s Bumped as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Vehicles cannot be Shaken, but if damage equals or exceeds their Toughness (whether they take a Wound or not), the driver must make a maneuvering roll or go <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong>.<br />Each raise on a vehicular damage roll causes a Wound and one roll on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Vehicle Critical Hits]{Vehicle Critical Hits}</strong> table (not one roll per Wound). Most vehicles can take three Wounds before they’re <strong>Wrecked</strong> (see below). Each Wound reduces a vehicle’s Handling by 1 (to a maximum of −4).<br />If this is a chase, damage that equals or exceeds a vehicle’s Toughness also <strong>Bumps</strong> it (see above), but only once per attacker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Called Shots on Vehicles:</strong> To target a par­ticular part of a vehicle, the GM assigns a modifier based on the dimensions of the target. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size &amp; Scale}</strong> and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover}</strong> for specifics. If the attack is successful and causes a Wound, it also causes the effects for that area (see the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Vehicle Critical Hits]{Vehicle Critical Hits}</strong> table).</p>\n<aside class=\"vehicle-attacks\">\n<h3>Fixed Weapons</h3>\n<p>Front-mounted weapons may only fire at targets ahead of them, side weapons to their respective sides, and rear weapons behind. Top or bottom mounted turreted weapons may fire in any direction unless the situation or particular vehicle says otherwise (assume ships, planes, or starships rise and fall during the turn to accommodate their top or bottom weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Side-Mounted Weapons (Cannons):</strong> Firing fixed side-mounted weapons—those that must be aimed by turning the entire vessel—must be positioned. The captain or pilot chooses his target and makes an opposed maneuvering roll as an action. Failure means he can’t line up a shot this turn. Success means the attacker may fire up to half his guns on one side at the target, and a raise means he may fire all of them at that target (a “broadside”).</p>\n<p>Treat each set of up to four cannons as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{\"linked\"}, rolling attacks and damage separately for each set.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossing the T:</strong> If a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Large} target (or greater) is hit by a broadside at @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Short Range}, it’s “raked” along its length. Add an additional d6 to each damage roll resulting from the rake.</p>\n<h3>Reaction Fire</h3>\n<p>Weapons with this quality spray massive amounts of matter or energy, making them quick to fire against enemies who dart in and out of range to attack. Once per round when their craft is attacked, Reaction Fire weapons may return fire at −2. The attack is resolved <em>after</em> the enemy’s who triggered it (if the gunner survives).</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Wrecked</h3>\n<p>Vehicles take three @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} before they’re “Wrecked” as their base. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Large} vehicles can take four Wounds, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Huge} can take five, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Gargantuans} can take six.</p>\n<p>A wrecked land vehicle can’t move, but its weapons may still be fired if they aren’t powered by the vehicle’s propulsion system.</p>\n<p>Watercraft sink. Small vessels sink in a few rounds. Medium boats might take up to an hour to slip beneath the surface, and large ships might take several hours.</p>\n<p>Aircraft plummet to the ground and are destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Occupants:</strong> Those inside a vehicle (and whatever it hits, if it matters) take damage depending on what caused the Wreck:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Collisions:</strong> If the vehicle is Wrecked from a Collision on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}</strong> table, the passengers suffer Xd6 damage, where X is equal to the Wounds the vehicle suffered from the collision (don’t forget any <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Vehicle Notes]{Air Bags &amp; Safety Harnesses}</strong>).</li>\n<li>Damage: If the vehicle is Wrecked from Wounds caused by enemy attacks, occu­pants in a land vehicle, speed boat, starship, or similar vessel take 3d6 damage, or 5d6 if the GM feels the vehicle was traveling at a high speed (usually in excess of 60 MPH) or some other precarious circumstance. Those on large boats or ships don’t take Wounds but must contend with Swimming rolls and survival afterward.<br />Occupants of an aircraft make an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll if they have parachutes to land safely. Failure means they take <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps &amp; Bruises}</strong>, from a hard landing. Those who roll a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} or are without parachutes plummet to their death, unless the GM feels they have a chance to survive. In that case they suffer <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Falling]{Falling}</strong> damage instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Repairs</h3>\n<p>Characters may repair vehicles given sufficient time and at least some basic tools. The attempt takes two hours per Wound and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair]{Repair} roll. If the roll fails, the mechanic must start over.</p>\n<p>Field work requires at least a toolbox and basic supplies, and subtracts 2 from the Repair roll. An average garage negates this penalty, and an excellent or dedicated facility adds +2.</p>\n<p>Each success and raise on the Repair roll fixes one of the vehicle’s Wounds. With an additional raise above and beyond what’s required to fix all Wounds, the repair time is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrecks: </strong>Wrecked vehicles can be repaired if the mechanic has access to a full body shop and spare parts (GM’s call). This takes a full day before other repairs can be made.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/Driveby.webp\" />\n<h2>Customized Chases</h2>\n<p>A little customization can make each chase different and unique. Here are some ideas you can use for your encounters.</p>\n<h3>City Streets</h3>\n<p>Busy streets are a dangerous place for high-speed vehicle or frantic foot chases. Ranged attacks are made at −2 (in addition to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} penalties) to account for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cover and Obstacles]{Cover} of buildings, cars, pedestrians, and so on.</p>\n<p>Complications besides Jokers have a mini­mum penalty of −2 to represent the dangers of running red lights, pedestrians that must be avoided, blocked streets, or other hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Rooftops:</strong> If the chase takes place on rooftops, change the results for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failures} (and failed Complications that say to treat the result as a Critical Failure) to the following:</p>\n<p>Roll a d6. On a 1–2, the runner loses his turn. On a 3–4, he takes Fatigue. On a 5–6, he tumbles over an edge and must make an immediate @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll (a free action). Success means he catches a ledge, railing, gutter, or other precipice and can pull himself up with a Strength roll (a free action each round). Failure means he’s stuck for the turn and can take no further actions. A Critical Failure means the hero falls d6 × 10 stories—or whatever the GM feels is appropriate for that city.</p>\n<h3>Deep Space</h3>\n<p>The <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Unstable Platform]{Unstable Platform}</strong> penalty usually applies in chases, but it can be ignored in the vacuum of deep space!</p>\n<h3>Dogfights &amp; Duels</h3>\n<p>The Chase rules generally assume the combatants are moving in the same direction—chasing prey, toward a target or escape route, etc. But the rules can also easily accommodate dogfights, tank battles, demolition derbies, and aerial or naval duels by arranging the Chase Cards in different ways.</p>\n<p>Instead of dealing the Chase Cards in a straight line, arrange them in a 4 × 4 grid to create a more fluid battlefield. Vehicles move and count Range orthogonally (no diagonals). Use common sense when determining weapon arcs and vehicle facings. A pirate ship with cannons on either side, for example, can fire left and right on an action, but can’t fire at targets ahead or behind them on the same action.</p>\n<p>Change the Range Increment as makes sense for your particular battle, letting the weapons with the longest ranges reach across the board but forcing those with shorter range to get in close.</p>\n<p>You can also place special cards in the grid to represent asteroid fields or space stations in space battles, whirlpools and islands in naval battles, and so on. They might be impassable or have their own special rules as you see fit.</p>\n<h3>Naval Chases</h3>\n<p>Bringing a target to battle on the high seas can take many hours or even days depending on the weather and the initial distance between the vessels.</p>\n<p>If the ships are more than a mile apart when first encountered, assume the first phase of the chase represents the pursuer trying to bring the prey to battle. Treat each round as about four hours (or much longer in the age of sail if the wind is against them) and the Range Increment as a <em>mile</em>.</p>\n<p>Once the pursuer reaches the same Chase Card as the prey, “zoom” in on the action and run the chase as usual, perhaps using the <strong>Dogfights and Duels</strong> option discussed above.</p>\n<div style=\"display:block;margin:auto;width:50%\"><img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg120_quote_yar.webp\" /></div>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Vehicles on the Tabletop</h2>\n<p>For car or boat chases and aerial or space duels with a lot of movement and mobility, use the Chase system. In tabletop battles where vehicles must operate in a confined space (and you want to use miniatures!), use these simple rules to handle the movement of most common land vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Movement</h3>\n<p>Vehicles can move up to 12″ on the tabletop (or their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} if slower than that) without having to make maneuvering rolls or worry about crashing into obstacles. At that speed they can move as desired and end their turn facing any direction.</p>\n<p>If a driver wants to go faster, up to 24″ per turn unless the GM says otherwise given the terrain and situation, he can do so but must make a maneuvering roll. The GM should assign a penalty (−1 to −4) if the move takes the vehicle through @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Difficult Ground}, tight turns, or hazards. If the roll is successful, the vehicle ends its move wherever the driver wants. Failure means the vehicle moves only 12″.</p>\n<p>A Critical Failure means the vehicle goes @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}. If that indicates a collision, the GM can move it into the nearest obstacle or decide it’s a feature not modeled on the tabletop such as a pothole, small ditch, fallen log, battlefield debris, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ramming is an opposed test of maneuvering skills. If the attacker hits, use the damage described under the <strong>Ram</strong> maneuver above.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/vehicles_on_tabletop.webp\" /> <em style=\"width:50%\">Printable \"Figure Flats\" of characters, vehicles, and monsters are available for most of our settings!</em></aside>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Red's Dead Redemption</h2>\n<p>Red is chasing a notorious space pirate who injured Gabe in a previous encounter. Both Red and the pirate have identical star fighters.</p>\n<p>Red is on the first Chase Card and the pirate’s on the fifth. That means the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is 200″ (4 × the Range Increment of 50″). That’s Long Range for her Gatling laser so she decides to get closer. She makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll as a free action and gets a 7, +2 for her ship’s Handling gives her a 9. That’s a success and a raise so she moves two Chase Cards closer.</p>\n<p>There are now two Chase Cards between Red and her target, or 100″. That’s Medium Range for her Gatling so she fires it up.</p>\n<p>The base TN is 4, −2 for Medium Range (no penalty for Unstable Platform in space!). The Rate of Fire on the Gatling is 4 though, so Red rolls four d10s (her Shooting skill) and a Wild die. She gets one regular hit and one with a raise. The regular hit causes 16 damage, which is 2 over the pirate’s Toughness of 14. The pirate must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll (he makes it) or go Out of Control. Since this is a Chase, Red also Bumps him a card <em>away</em>—a smart move since the pirate goes next.</p>\n<p>Now Red resolves the hit with a raise. This one causes a Wound. She can’t Bump the pirate again in her same turn, but he still has to make another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} roll or go @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Out of Control]{Out of Control}. He fails this time and rolls a 3 on the table, which gives him another Wound. Since he took Wounds from the attack, he takes a Critical Hit as well. It’s a 5, so his Top Speed drops 10%. He’s now slower than Red so she adds +1 to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Piloting]{Piloting} rolls when changing positions.</p>\n<h2>Crews</h2>\n<p>Passengers and crews go in whatever order they decide on their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Card}. This can make for dramatic and interactive experiences with a little narrative interpretation. On a pirate ship, the captain makes the maneuvering (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating}) rolls. The rest of the player characters fire a cannon, take a shot with a musket (if the captain is willing to get that close!), yell insults at the enemy (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Test}), or point out hazards (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Support]{Support} for the captain’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Boating]{Boating} rolls).</p>\n<p>The player character-controlled “bridge crew” of a starship can do the same. Maybe the captain focuses on Testing the enemy in a duel of wits and leaves the maneuvering rolls to the Navigation officer. The Weapons officers fire weapons while the Engineer Supports the navigator, captain, or gunners as needed each turn.</p>\n<h2>Reminders</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add or subtract Chase Cards to the track as needed.</li>\n<li>A character’s <em>Action Card</em> determines if a Complication occurs, but his <em>Chase Card</em> determines any penalty and results of failure.</li>\n<li>Dealing with a Complication is a free action.</li>\n<li>Evade and Hold Steady are good options for characters who don’t expect frequent chases and so don’t have Edges like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Steady Hands]{Steady Hands}.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/space-battle.webp\" /></div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_coxsqc2solv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"8UH8HC3QNJ07Lt1u","name":"Elf, Drow","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Drow Elf</h1>\n<p>Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p>\n<p>When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p>\n<p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p>\n<h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3>\n<p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p>\n<p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member ofyour adventuring party.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Drow are graceful and agile.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using Smarts is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Mages must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper.

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for providing taxes and military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. It was acknowledged that all power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. Throughout Galifar, the nobility remained the foundation of the united kingdom. Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service. Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the nobles didn’t administer justice, but it was their duty to maintain the system, appointing justices and maintaining the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and as life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, it remained the case that the majority of property was associated with a noble’s domain, and that it was the local lord who appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to the count, the count to their duke, the duke to the prince, the prince to the king.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Common Knowledge, Intimidation, Persuasion, Traditions</p>\n<p><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Aristocract, Charismatic, House Scion, Rich, Filthy Rich</p>\n<p><strong>Social Edges:</strong> Connections</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.zds95QdTAYavucmH"},"cf":{"id":"temp_pkglbsbzxv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"AWkCLhQQu3yfAeqx","name":"Changeling","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Changeling</h1>\n<p>Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>A Hidden People</h3>\n<p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p>\n<p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p>\n<p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p>\n<h3>Masks and Personas</h3>\n<p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>\n<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</strong> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear. The power has no limit on duration. When they die they return to their natural form.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Changeling Instinct]{Changeling Instinct}:</strong> Changelings are socially and psychologically intuitive due to their adoption and understanding of different personas.

{"_id":"D7nRfh7AIcJRwZdK","name":"Shifter","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Shifter</h1>\n<p>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h3>The Beast Within</h3>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h3>Similiar and Diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Yet to Come</h3>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Keen Senses: </strong>Shifters have heighted senses. They begin with a d6 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} skill. This increases their maximum @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Low Light Vision]{Low Light Vision}:</strong> <strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Shifters have the sight of their beastial ancestors who have hunted in the night and their eyes amplify light. </span></strong>Low Light Vision ignores up –2 penalties for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]{Dim and Dark Illumination}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]{Pitch Darkness} remains unaffected.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Shifting]{Shifting} (Minor Shape Change): </strong>This ability allows a shifter to tap into his lycanthropic heritage. At character creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting is a free action and lasts 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Damage Effects]{wound penalty}. When the shifting ends, the shifter must wait 4 hours before shifting again or suffer a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} when the second shifting ends. This level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from shifting. If the shifter uses this ability again during the recovery time, it inflicts another level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} that requires an additional 4 hours of recovery time.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Beasthide]{Beasthide}:</strong> The skin of beasthide shifters harden, providing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Armor]{Armor} +4.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Cliffwalk]{Cliffwalk}: </strong>The limbs, hands, and feet of cliffwalk shifters become stronger, allowing cliffwalk shifters to add +2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} (climbing) rolls, and climb at their full @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Pace}.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Dreamsight]{Dreamsight}:</strong> Dreamsight shifters' instincts and awareness become heightened, granting them the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Beast Friend]{beast friend}</em> power. The power affects animals of Size +1 or smaller as well as swarms of Small size. Its effects only last while shifting rather than the power's normal duration.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Gorebrute]{Gorebrute}: </strong>Gorebrute shifters manifest powerful horns that can inflict @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength}+d6 damage (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons} in Savage Worlds Adventure Edition core rules).</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Longtooth]{Longtooth}: </strong>The face of a longtooth shifter distorts, growing a canine muzzle full of sharp teeth that cause @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Longtooth are also particularly fierce and agressive. They start with a d4 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Razorclaw]{Razorclaw}: </strong>The claws on the hands of razorclaw shifters grow and can be used to make attacks dealing @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Razorclaw shifters respect little other than physical power. They get a +1 bonus to all @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Swiftstride]{Swiftstride}:</strong>The legs of swiftstride shifters elongate and they balance on the balls of their feet. Their base @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Pace} increases by 2 and their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{running die} increases a die type.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Swiftwing]{Swiftwing}: </strong>The arms of swiftwing shifters grow leather flaps of skin similar to a bat's wings, granting the ability to fly at a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Pace} of 6 per round, and \"run\" for extra movement as usual. Maneuvering uses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill. These wings can be targeted, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Entangled} by foes.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Truedive]{Truedive}: </strong>Truedive shifters grow fins and webs of skin between their toes and fingers.

The process isn’t like the spells of a wizard or the tools of an artificer, nor is it a divine petition to a higher power. Well, not exactly. Legend recounts how the great progenitor dragon Eberron enveloped the jealous evil of Khyber in the living prison that would become the world. If arcane magic comes from the tears of Siberys above, then Druidic magic is the blood and breath of Eberron herself, granting power to those who seek to defend her and the natural order from the threats beyond.</p>\n<p>Most druids are swathed in tradition, usually initiated by a sect that teaches the secrets of this primal magic while also charging the aspirant with specific duties. While some sects are loosely aligned, each one has its own ideas as to the role their kind should play in the world.</p>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature’s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Civilization</h3>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature’s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<p>You can roll on the <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore-tables.Druidic Beliefs]{Druidic Beliefs}</strong> table to see how your druid views civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Sovereign Host</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the Sovereign Host is a civilized faith with shrines in the great cities of the Five Nations but a number of shrines to deities tied to nature can be found in the wilds. Balinor is the Sovereign of the Hunt, Arawai brings nature’s bounty, and the Devourer embodies its destructive power and the hunger that reclaims its waste. In Eberron, a priest of Balinor isn’t inherently required to follow one trail or the other, but the main differences between the two lay in how command of nature is granted, and the purpose for which they use it. While it’s common for the two paths to recognize one another, such respect isn’t always equal.</p>\n<p>From a philosophical perspective, a druid is an envoy of nature with a connection to the environment itself, not a servant of a higher power. By contrast, the cleric serves a higher power and holds dominion over the natural world. While druids shun such metal armaments, nature clerics usually practice combat in manmade heavy metal armors until proficient. Yet, clerics lack the primal understanding required to communicate in Druidic and to assume Wild Shape, which is a reflection of the druid’s deep connection to the natural world.</p>\n<p>Such differences lead to a deep disconnect between the typical druid and a nature worshiping cleric. The Warden of the Wood might see the priests of Balinor as an arrogant outsider, a city-dweller who believes that humanoids hold some sort of divine right over the planet, which is admittedly often the case. To the priestess of Arawai, nature is something that serves the people and her primary concern is ensuring a bountiful harvest, not driving farmers from their fields.</p>\n<p>While this is the obvious contrast, it’s possible to create a character who uses one class while following the opposite path. Perhaps you want to play a priest of Balinor but you love the idea of hunting in the form of a wolf, or you want to be Ashbound but have no interest in ever assuming a Wild Shape. While there will be the occasional disconnect, like the Ashbound cleric can’t use Wild Shape, the Balinor druid can’t turn undead, look to juxtapose these ideas to best match the story and experience you’re looking for, using backgrounds like the acolyte or outlander to cultivate the option.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Druids must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Druids interact constantly with nature, drawing all their power from it. They regularly perform various rituals while they rest or pray. They regularly tend to the natural order of things. This opens their conduits of power to the natural energies and allows them to activate powers later without begining the appeal in the moment. </p>\n<p>Druidic powers are cast through chants, talismans, and talking with nature itself. Depending on the spell, the druid may cast bones, sprinkle of ash, rubbing a talisman, beseeching the forces of nature. Trappings for the spells of druids should all include natural components or aspects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"E4B3M0r8H3bubm5c","name":"Dramatic Tasks","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<h1 class=\"wide\">Dramatic Tasks</h1>\n  \t\n\t\t\t<p>Heroes often find themselves in tense and dangerous situations such as disabling a complex trap, climbing a rock face while under fire from archers, or rescuing people from a burning building or sinking ship with a definite — and sometimes deadly — time limit.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This system simulates these events and helps the Game Master insert some drama into what would otherwise be simple skill rolls.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Dramatic Tasks are great for tense actions that must be performed in a hurry or have disastrous effects if failed.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> The heroes make skill rolls to accumulate \"Task Tokens\" and resolve the event before time runs out.</p>\n\t\t\t\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The GM starts by figuring out what the task is, how long the party has to complete it, and how many tokens they need for success.</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Single Person Tasks</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Use these guidelines when only a single character can attempt the task each turn (others can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}):</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Challenging:</span> Collect four Task Tokens in three rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a trap in the dark, pick a lock before a guard returns, disengage a moving horse-team from its wagon.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Difficult:</span> Collect six Task Tokens in four rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a trap in the middle of combat, cast a ritual, sail a craft to shore during a storm.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Complex:</span> Collect eight Task Tokens in five rounds. <em>Examples:</em> Disable a particularly complicated and/or dangerous trap, Pick a very difficult lock or series of locks before a patrol returns, cast a large and powerful ritual, repair a complicated machine with multiple moving parts.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<h3>Multi-Person Tasks</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>If more than one person can attempt the task at once, such as crewing a ship, the GM must set the number of rounds and tokens required for victory herself. Here are some guidelines.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Assume each player will average one success per turn. Use that as a guideline if you want the task to be \"fair,\" and set the number of rounds from three to five as appropriate. A party of five given three rounds to save a galleon in a storm, for example, needs to accumulate 15 Task Tokens in three rounds. Increase or decrease the number of tokens to make it more or less challenging.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>If the number of tokens achieved is a measure of success rather than a straight win/fail condition, such as rescuing victims from a fire or hauling up bags of gold from a collapsing mineshaft, simply set the possible number of tokens that may be gathered in the time allowed. Each token gathered represents a person saved, a bag recovered, etc. It’s up to you whether it’s possible to save them all (using the guide above) or not.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Let the party choose how many will attempt the task, especially if there’s something else going on at the same time. Deciding how many heroes will break into the jail to rescue a friend while the others fight off the corrupt city guard allows <em>them</em> to choose their tactics.</p>\n\t\t\t\n<h2>Performing the Task</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Characters are dealt @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} as usual during a Dramatic Task. Those attempting the task make relevant skill checks and get a Task Token for each success and raise. Failure means no progress and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} reduces progress by one (if any has been made).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The skills that can be used to accumulate tokens depends on the situation. They might be defined, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to disable a trap, or they might be open — a heroic paladin might use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to carry people from a burning building while a mage uses <em>telekinesis</em> (@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting}) to do the same.</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Multiple Skills</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>The GM can break tasks down into steps if she likes, each of which might require different skills. If disabling a difficult trap in the dark, for example, the heroes might first have to get two tokens to get the feel for their surroundings using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, then three more tokens using Thievery to cut all three trip wires in the correct order.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Requiring multiple skills throughout the task makes it more difficult since raises from one type of skill check don’t carry over to the other. In the trap example above, for example, the first step requires two Notice successes. Additional successes <em>don’t</em> carry over to the Thievery rolls needed afterward.</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Complications</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>If a character’s Action Card is a Club, something has gone wrong. Attempts to resolve the task (or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} it!) are made at an additional −2. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Worse, if a roll is failed during a Complication, the Dramatic Task fails — the trap springs, the lock jams, a victim cannot be saved, and so on. The character may choose <em>not</em> to attempt a roll on a turn he has a Complication — it just costs him precious time.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Support:</strong> Characters assisting (via Support)also suffer the Complication penalty, and an additional −2 if <em>their</em> Action Card is a Club! @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} on their part just subtracts from the lead’s roll as usual, however, it doesn’t cause the entire task to fail.</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Death Traps</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Think carefully before designing Dramatic Tasks that might wipe out the entire party if failed. The threat of catastrophe should be very real but you don’t want a couple of bad die rolls to end the entire game. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Instead of total disaster, maybe the party has a moment to dive clear before the trap triggers. They don’t perish, but later awake in the care of a local healer or are captured and find themselves about to experience a new type of adventure.</p>\n\t\t\t\n<h2 class=\"example\">Example: Dragon fire!</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<p>An evil red dragon roams the countryside, burning farms and villages throughout the land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Seelah]{Seelah} the paladin and @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Harsk]{Harsk} the ranger watch in horror as the dragon breathes fire down on their favorite tavern. The pair rush to aid the choking and gasping patrons attempting to flee the burning building.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The Game Master decides rescuing the survivors is a three-round, Multi-Person Dramatic Task. There are 10 patrons. Each success saves one of them from the inferno.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the first round, Seelah and Harsk roll @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to run into the tavern and drag someone out. Both get a raise, so that's four citizens saved!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The next round, Harsk gets a Complication. The GM decides he becomes trapped in one of the back rooms and must make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} roll at −2. If he fails, it takes him too long to escape and he won't be able to save any more patrons. Harsk draws his brother's trusty @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Axe, Battle]{battleaxe} and hacks his way free. He decides to go with it and narrates using his Fighting to hack open a hole in the wall for the survivors. He's successful, and Seelah gets a raise this turn with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} — yelling at the locals to help throw water on the fire. That's seven total patrons saved.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the third round, Seelah gets a Complication and fails — she's choking on smoke and can't help. Fortunately, after spending a few Bennies, Harsk manages to get two @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raises} and pull the last patrons from the fire.</p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/dragon-fire.webp\" />\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_coxsqc2solv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

power beyond the marvels of civilization. These primal magics are guarded by servants of balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these protectors shield their lands from all who threaten them. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with wisdom long forgotten by civilization.</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Arcane Background</span> <strong>(Druid):</strong> Druids use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Faith]{Faith} as their arcane skill.

Those drawing energy from divine sources must uphold the principles of the Nature Domain. <br />If the druid violates her deity's trust  (GM's call) the druid subtracts 2 from Faith rolls for a week.

{"_id":"IwlAzxyHDWKK3dGS","name":"Gnome","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Gnome</h1>\n<p>The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Scribing]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Gnome Magic]{Gnome Magic}: </strong>Gnomes are inherently magical creatures.

They have 1 Power Point for activating these cantrips, regained as usual. Gnomes with an Arcane Background or Mystic Power or Dragonmark add their bonus Power Point to their pool but must still learn the spells if they wish to cast them normally.</li>\n<li><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> Gnomes start with a d6 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} instead of a d4.

Magic, both light and dark, flows through everything. The study and use of it has happpened by mystical beings such as dragons and Overlords, since the birth of the World ro present times. Much of this study and use has gone into pooling the energy into items of power.</p>\n<h3>Detecting Magic Items</h3>\n<p>In the magically-charged world of Eberron, any character with an Arcane Background can sense magical or divine auras within 5” (10 yards), unless they are magically concealed. This is an action.</p>\n<p>Detecting magic at a greater range or gaining specific information requires the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{detect arcana} spell, which can also be used to reveal items or beings protected by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{conceal magic}. </p>\n<h3>Identifying Powers of Magical Items</h3>\n<p>There are three methods for determining what powers reside within an item. First, an arcane spellcaster can deduce the powers within an item simply through study. How long it takes is up to you, but a few minutes for a potion (given some basic testing equipment or a more dangerous taste test) and an hour for other items is usually enough.</p>\n<p>Second, <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{Identify (from detect arcana)}</em> can be used to identify a magic item's powers and how they work.</p>\n<p>Third, <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Object Reading]{object reading}</em> will reveal the powers of any object the spellcaster is touching when he casts the spell. This would be seperate from the casting to determine if the item is in fact magical, and means a mage might need to cast it twice (once to detect magic and once to scrutinize).</p>\n<h3>Attuning</h3>\n<p>A hero who wishes to wield a magical item and benefit from it's power must first attune himself. Attunement can only happen after knowledge of the items powers and benefits has been discerned. The hero must then spend one hour with the item, and they are then attuned to it an may use it's powers.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Common Magic Item Rules</span></h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Active Powers are Actions:</strong> An item that requires a Trait roll is an action unless it says otherwise. Critical Failure means the user takes Fatigue (and loses a charge if the item has them).</li>\n<li><strong>Edges and Abilities:</strong> If an item grants an Edge or Monstrous Ability and the wielder already has that Edge, it grants the improved version (if there is one).</li>\n<li><strong>Minor and Major Powers:</strong> Some items grant minor or major powers as listed with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers}. A <em>minor</em> power automatically activates with the effect of a standard success, and a <em>major</em> power activates with the effect of a raise (no Trait roll is made). Unless the item says otherwise, this is an action and the effect lasts for the power’s full Duration and cannot be maintained.</li>\n<li><strong>Stacking:</strong> If two sources would increase a Trait, use only the highest modifier (effects don’t stack). Increases to a Trait from a magic item’s effects don’t count for determining Trait Advancements. They do affect secondary statistics like Parry or Toughness, however.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Items:</strong> A character can only wear one magic item in each location (head, eyes, shoulders, neck, chest, belt, wrists, hands, feet). Putting on a second necklace or a second belt, for example, has no effect. The exception to this rule is rings. A character can wear two rings and benefit from both magical effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Enemies with Magic Items</h3>\n<p>Enemy characters and monsters equipped with enchanted and magical items have the bonuses conferred by those items built into their profiles.</p>\n<p>So an evil knight wearing plate armor enchanted with the Aegis enchantment, for example, might have a Toughness of 12(5), where the plate armor's bonus of +4 has already been increased by the Aegis enchantment's +1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Articles on Magic Items</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic Items]{Using Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Purchasing Magic Items]{Purchasing Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Enchantments]{Enchantments}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Crafting Magic Items]{Crafting Magic Items}</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/people/artificer-infusing-armor.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_xadnq2n2oe8","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/6.

{"_id":"KSMBz6b82i7E4UsI","name":"Conviction","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h2>Conviction</h2>\n<p>Conviction is a special award granted when a character experiences a great victory or catastrophic misfortune. If possible, use a themed token to note the award; maybe a Marshal’s Badge for <cite>Deadlands</cite>, a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{Benny} of a different color, a toy doubloon for <cite>50 Fathoms</cite>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Conviction can be spent to add a d6 to all a character’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Trait} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Dealing Damage]{damage} totals until the beginning of her next @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Actions]{turn}. This die can @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Ace}, and its result is added to the final total.</p>\n<p>Conviction tokens aren’t @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{Bennies} and can’t be used as such. They <em>are</em> kept between sessions, however.</p>\n<p>A character may maintain Conviction from round to round by spending a Benny (at the start of his turn, before it runs out). Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p>\n<h3>Triumph And Tragedy</h3>\n<p>Conviction is granted for personal triumph and tragedy, drawing on a character’s entire background, including—but not limited to—his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances}.</p>\n<p>Savage settings may also grant Conviction for certain world-specific actions or events.</p>\n<p><strong>Triumph:</strong> Characters gain Conviction when they overcome significant obstacles core to their overall goals and motivations. This might mean defeating powerful enemies, saving a true love, or overcoming some great mystery or problem.</p>\n<p>The victory should be an achievement over and above the usual. A vampire hunter in <cite>Rippers</cite> shouldn’t get Conviction every time he kills a vampire, for example, but he might when he wipes out an entire coven or slays a powerful master vamp­ire. A super hero might gain Conviction when she saves her true love from a death trap or the clutches of a powerful villain. She wouldn’t earn it just because her boyfriend is in a dangerous encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Some of the most interesting heroes of fiction, film, and legend spend as much time battling their personal demons as they do fighting their foes. Eventually these same issues give them strength as they work through their grief or overcome obstacles to rise once more against the challenges they face.</p>\n<p>When a character experiences a significant personal loss or destructive event, and the GM feels it’s appropriate, he gains Conviction. The death of a loved one or close friend (including a party member he was close to), losing an important job, giving in to harmful character flaws and vices, being removed from a case or quest, or getting framed for a crime are all classic examples of heroic tragedy.</p>\n<p>These might happen in the course of the game, but players should also proactively suggest their own ideas to the Game Master. Consider your hero’s backstory and occasionally look for ways to do what your favorite authors do to their characters—torture them! Think about what’s important to them and threaten it or take it away. Most of the time this should be done as a quick narrative tale or a scene with a little interaction and roleplaying so as not to distract from the main campaign or the other players’ time, but occasionally it might inspire a side-trek or adventure to regain—or avenge!—whatever was lost.</p>\n<p>Note that earning Conviction for harmful behavior is motivation for players in a game to occasionally spotlight their character’s dark side. It is not an endorsement or rationalization of poor conduct in the real world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Red's Rage</h2>\n<p>Emily is Red, a fighter in a fantasy campaign. She has “anger management issues” but didn’t take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Mean]{Mean} Hindrance because she’s had her problem under control for a year or so. But it’s a fun part of her backstory and Emily loves roleplaying constantly managing her character’s temper.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Red and her constant ally Gabe failed in their last adventure. Emily decides this is a good time for Red to go on a rampage. She narrates a story about going into town and terrorizing everyone in sight with her surly attitude. During the course of a “bad day,” she breaks a window, turns over an apple cart, and even insults a friar’s mule!</p>\n<p>The GM loves Emily’s story and awards her a point of Conviction. In the game, Red is barred from the local tavern, has to pay for all the damage she caused, and is refused help by the friar (the town’s only healer!) until she performs some act of penance (a new quest!)</p>\n<p>More importantly, Emily told a story about her heroine’s tragic flaw—and has a point of Conviction to carry her through the next chapter of her quest.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_rv4q29jrhjs","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"KxFfUAb8Xj8zlzRK","name":"Elf","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Elf</h1>\n<p>Tens of thousands ofyears ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p>\n<p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p>\n<p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p>\n<p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p>\n<h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Shadow]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Shadow]{Mark of Shadow}</em><em> </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings.</p>\n<h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3>\n<p>For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p>\n<p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Elves are graceful and agile.

psionics is the art of tapping the mind’s potential. A psionic character is blessed with a form of innate ability that enables him or her to use mental power to achieve goals or perform tasks that nonpsionic characters can accomplish—if they’re even capable of doing them at all—only by using gross physical skills such as brute strength or raw agility, or by using intellect or force of will distinct from the natural power of the mind itself.</p>\n<p>Your character’s mind is an infinite metaphorical plane, where all things are possible. It may be that all characters have within them the potential for harnessing the energy of the mind, but only those who succeed in tapping into that potential can become psionic characters. A psionic character knows the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of thought and energy. Knowing the path, the psionic character walks it. Like a flare being thrown off a star, a power is manifested from a psionic character’s energy of consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Secrets of the Mind</h3>\n<p>From the duergar traditions of the Akiak dwarves to the quori techniques of the kalashtar and Inspired, psionics are strong in Sarlona. Adventurers might have no recourse but to travel to Sarlona to learn certain psionic arts. The traditions of the psychic warrior are begining to find their way to Khorvaire, but it is still very rare.</p>\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Psionic powers spring from sentient minds and are manifested through intense concentration. The psion merely needs to concentrate to manifest his inborn powers, drawing on his abilities by tapping a reservoir of mental strength. He has no need for messy material components, verbal cues, or awkward gestures.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>TRappings of psionic power are wide and varied. They can draw fire from thin air, move a boulder without touching it, catch a glimpse of the future, and communicate with others who are miles away. Force is a common trapping for psionic powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"MFfSUaRTzgUnMaY8","name":"1 Gear","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<div class=\"chapter-heading\">\n<h1>Gear</h1>\n<figure class=\"chapter-number\">Chapter Two</figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"drop-cap\">This section contains rules and equipment. Read the notes below before you go to the outfitters to understand what various keywords mean.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Costs</h2>\n<p>Characters are assumed to have clothes and other personal items. If the GM allows it, adventurers may also have a home with other supplies and necessities.</p>\n<p>The starting funds (300 gp) are for “adventuring gear” in addition to such personal items. The costs listed in the following sections represent standards; in the marketplace or the bazaar, all costs are negotiable. Character gear lists don’t need to include anything beyond “adventuring gear”.</p>\n<p>Use the lists and prices in this book as a baseline for your game when looking for equipment that isn't listed here.</p>\n<p>Some items are extremely difficult to price because they're created by decree or necessity, such as engineers and soldiers in a siege building catapults and trebuchets. Their prices reflect an estimate of the time and resources needed to create them.</p>\n<h2>Gear Notes</h2>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<p>This is the amount of Armor provided by the equipment, listed in parentheses beside the wearer’s total Toughness. Unless an attacker states otherwise, hits are always directed at the victim’s torso.</p>\n<p>Worn armor doesn't stack with other worn armor, but does stack with natural armor (such as scaly skin) at its full value.</p>\n<h3>Armor Piercing (AP)</h3>\n<p>The weapon or projectile ignores this many points of Armor value. A weapon with an AP value of 4, for instance, ignores 4 points of Armor. Excess AP is lost.</p>\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n<p>Damage is listed in terms of dice. Projectile weapons have fixed damage (such as 2d6). Melee weapons have damage based on the wielder’s Strength die plus another die, as listed under individual weapon entries. A dagger, for instance, inflicts Str+d4 damage.</p>\n<h3>Heavy weapon (HW)</h3>\n<p>The weapon can affect vehicles or other devices with <strong>Heavy Armor</strong> (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Vehicles]{Vehicles}). This is not to be confused with categories of personal armor— such as heavy armor or shields.</p>\n<h3>Minimum Strength</h3>\n<p>Certain items have a “Minimum Strength” required to use without penalty. Note that some items list a d4 since it is possible to have a Strength lower than d4.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Armor/Shields/Worn Gear:</span> Each die type differ­ence between the character’s Strength and the item’s Minimum Strength inflicts a −1 penalty to Pace (minimum of 1), Agility, and Agility-related skill rolls. This is cumulative for those weak but determined adventurers who wear or use multiple items too heavy for their build.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Melee/Thrown Weapons:</span> A thrown or melee weapon’s damage die is limited by the user’s Strength die. If a scrawny kid (Strength d4) picks up a long sword (Str+d8), he rolls d4+d4 damage instead of d4+d8. Also, if the user’s Strength is less than its Minimum Strength, he doesn’t benefit from any of the weapon’s positive abilities such as Reach or Parry bonuses. He still retains any penalties, however.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Weapons:</span> The user suffers a −1 attack penalty for each die step difference between his Strength and the weapon’s minimum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Parry</h3>\n<p>The weapon adds the bonus to the character’s Parry score. If a character wields a weapon in each hand, penalties to Parry stack but bonuses do not (unless she has the Ambidextrous Edge). This also applies to carrying two shields at once (use the best Parry bonus).</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>This lists the weapon’s Short, Medium, and Long Range. Extreme Range is up to 4×its Long Range. See <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranged Attacks]{Ranged Attacks}</strong> for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} (throwing) modifiers and more details.</p>\n<p>Ranges are listed in inches so you can use a ruler to move, shoot, and fight on the tabletop with miniatures. If you’re not using miniatures, each inch equals two yards (6 feet).</p>\n<p>Weapon ranges are “effective” ranges for the table-top.</p>\n<h3>Rate of Fire</h3>\n<p>This is the number of shots that may be fired by this weapon in a single action. See <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rate of Fire]{Rate of Fire}</strong> for further details.</p>\n<h3>Reach</h3>\n<p>Weapons with “Reach” allow their user to make Fighting attacks at the listed range. A Reach of 1, for example, allows a character to strike a target 1″ (2 yards) distant. Weapons without a Reach value can only strike targets at arm’s length (adjacent).</p>\n<p>Reach can be very important when fighting from horseback and <em>against</em> mounted foes (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mounted Combat]{Mounted Combat}).</p>\n<h3>Reload</h3>\n<p>A character can ready and fire a bow every action— see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reloading]{Reloading}. Heavy crossbows and black powder muskets are slower to reload. The number after the Reload keyword is how many actions of reloading it takes before a weapon can be fired again.</p>\n<h3>Two Hands</h3>\n<p>A two-handed weapon can be used with one hand at a −4 penalty. The hero counts full Strength for damage but loses all other advantages such as Reach or Parry bonuses.</p>\n<p>Two-handed weapons are normally required to make use of the Sweep Edge.</p>\n<h2>Encumbrance</h2>\n<p>Most of the time you don’t need to worry about how much weight a character is carrying. If it becomes important to track, use the <strong>Encumbrance Levels</strong> table. If a character carries more than the listed weight, he’s Encumbered.</p>\n<p>Encumbered characters subtract 2 from Pace (minimum 1), running rolls, Agility and all linked skills, and Vigor rolls made to resist <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}</strong>.</p>\n<p>At three times the lifted weight or more, he can move at a Pace of 1 for a number of rounds equal to his Vigor. Every round thereafter he must succeed at a Vigor roll or take a level of Fatigue.</p>\n<p>The maximum weight a character can lift or carry is four times the listed weight.</p>\n<p><strong>Bulky Items:</strong> Carrying a bulky, awkward, or unbalanced item, such as a large box, treasure chest, a person, and so on, may make a character Encumbered despite its actual weight (GM’s call).</p>\n<table style=\"width:80%\"><colgroup> <col></col> <col></col> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Encumbrance</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading center\">Strength</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading center\">Can Freely Carry Up To...</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">d4</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">20 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">d6</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">40 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">d8</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">60 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">d10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">80 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">d12</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">100 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"centered\">Each +1</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">+20 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Currency</h2>\n<p><cite>Pathfinder for Savage Worlds</cite> uses a gold standard for trade across Eberron. In general, commerce relies on four precious metals, coined throughout the continents. Some traders accept gemstones when bargaining.</p>\n<p>Naturally, trade also occurs via bartering, although most characters (and merchants!) prefer coins when buying or selling wares. Costs default to gold pieces (gp) on Gear tables unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<table><colgroup> <col></col> <col></col> <col></col> <col></col> <col></col> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"5\">Coins &amp; exchange value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"sub-heading left\">Coin</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading\">CP</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading\">SP</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading\">GP</th>\n<th class=\"sub-heading\">PP</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper (cp)</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/100</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver (sp)</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold (gp)</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">100</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum (pp)</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1,000</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">100</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">10</td>\n<td class=\"centered\">1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Special Materials</h2>\n<p>Weapons and armor are often created with special materials found on Eberron. These materials improve combat effectiveness or have effects against creatures with resistances and weaknesses. Special materials don’t stack, only the best quality applies in any situation.</p>\n<p>Anything made from the following materials is considered masterwork, adding 300 gp to its base cost before other cost modifiers (see @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Masterwork]{Masterwork}).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Adamantine:</span> Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine adds +1 AP to any melee weapon or ranged weapon ammunition made of its metal. This stacks with the bonus from masterwork items. Adamantine weapons cost an additional 3,000 gp. Ammunition costs an addition 60 gp per missile.<br />Adamantine armor is harder to pierce than that made from other materials. It ignores up to 2 points of AP. Armor made from this material costs an extra 3,000 gp per point of armor bonus.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Darkwood:</span> This rare wood is much lighter than normal. Items carved from it weigh half as much as typical equivalents and cost an additional 10 gp per pound of the original weight to the price of a masterwork version of the item. Darkwood items increase Hardness (or Toughness if the hull of a vehicle) by 2.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dragonhide:</span> Armorers can fashion their products with the hides of dragons when such wonders become available. The number of armor pieces that can be crafted from a single dragon is equal to half its size (rounded up). The hide can be used to craft light, medium, or heavy armor and counts as masterwork, granting the same bonus as other armors of the same type ( +2 to +4). Additionally, wearing dragonhide armor grants the wearer an additional +4 armor against the element tied to the dragon's breath weapon. For example, blue dragonhide gives resistance to electricity. This benefit stacks with the Energy Resistance enchantment. Dragonhide costs an additional 2500 gp beyond the cost of the normal armor it's mimicking. So a Dragonhide Breastplate costs 3000 gp.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Iron, Cold:</span> Mined from the deepest depths of Eberron, cold iron is the weakness of certain demons and fey creatures. Weapons forged with cold iron increase Hardness by 2 and cost twice as much as normal.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Mithral:</span> A rare metal on Eberron, mithral is forged like steel but weighs much less. Mithral reduces the Minimum Strength of weapons, armor, and shields one die type (this stacks with the bonus from masterwork) and the weight by half. Weapons and shields made primarily of mithral (GM's call) cost 100 times normal, while armor costs 10 times normal <em>per piece.</em><br />Mithral weapons count as silver for purposes of creatures with a silver Weakness.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Silver, Alchemical:</span> A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a steel weapon. This allows them to affect creatures with a Weakness to silver, such as lycanthropes. They cost ten times normal price.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Masterwork</h2>\n<p>Masterwork items are finely crafted versions of normal gear made by top artisans.</p>\n<p>Weapons of masterwork quality are +1 AP. Masterwork melee and ranged weapons add 300 gp to the cost.</p>\n<p>Masterwork arrows, bolts, or other ammunition subtract 1 point of Range penalty at Long or Extreme Range, and cost six additional gold pieces per unit. Masterwork ammunition loses its bonus after use even if recovered.</p>\n<p>Armor and shields of masterwork quality reduce the Minimum Strength requirement by one die type, to a minimum of d4. Shields cost an extra 300 gp, while armor costs an extra 150 gp <em>per piece.</em></p>\n<p>You can’t usually upgrade existing armor, weapons, or shields to masterwork quality— they must be crafted to high standards from the beginning.</p>\n<p>The availability of masterwork items— whether for sale in the marketplace or commissioned— depends on the size of the settlement and is up to the GM.

/>\n<h2>Playing those with Innate Magic</h2>\n<p>Those with innate magic, create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories—just raw power that they direct at will. Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.</p>\n<h3>Raw Magic</h3>\n<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or ataste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So toa might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the [nner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>\n<p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on. nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>\n<h2>CASTING</h2>\n<p>Sorcerers must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Wielding magic that is innate and from some untold force, sorcerers can wield very versatile magic. There are no limitations on the kinds of trappings that can be utilized by a sorcerer.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

They don't usually have a game effect of their\n    own, but are important for atmosphere and theme.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    One character might fire magical missiles of glowing white energy while\n    another hurls deadly icicles. Both use the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em> power and share the\n    same mechanics, but they look and \"feel\" different.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Trappings <em>do</em> matter when an obstacle or opponent has a particular\n    strength or weakness. If an ice troll suffers +4 damage from fire- or\n    heat-based attacks, for example, a <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Blast]{blast}</em> a player describes as a\n    fireball counts as a fire attack and does +4 damage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once described, a power’s Trappings don’t change unless the caster uses an\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Advancement]{Advance}.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A character can alter the power’s effects or Trappings as she wishes using\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}</strong>.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Synergy</h3>\n  <p>\n    Sometimes logic dictates a power’s Trapping should have some additional\n    effect. Zapping someone with a lightning bolt while they’re standing in\n    water should cause additional damage, for example.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When this occurs, the GM can decide there’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Synergy]{synergy} that either increases or\n    decreases the effect or damage (GM’s call) by +2 or −2.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Oppositional forces, such as fire and ice or light and darkness,\n    <em>don’t</em> have synergy against one another (though such effects are\n    sometimes accounted for in some creatures’ @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Special Abilities]{Special Abilities)}. If a fire\n    <em>blast</em> hits ice armor<em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{(protection)}</em>, for example, there’s no\n    additional effect because they cancel each other out.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Adding &amp; Changing Trappings</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    A character can learn two new powers when he takes the\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers}</strong> Edge. \n    He may instead add Trappings to\n    his powers in place of one or two of the new powers. A hero who takes the\n    New Powers Edge, for example, could choose one new power and add an ice\n    Trapping to her <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>. The GM may also allow a player to\n    <em>change</em> the Trapping of existing power when she gains an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Advancement]{Advance}.\n    This should reflect a major change in the character in some way as\n    determined by the player and GM.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Limitations</h2>\n  <div>\n    <img class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/storm-woman.webp')\" src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/storm-woman.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"424\" />\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Sometimes a power’s Trapping imposes a limitation on the power. \n    This gives the power focus at the expense of versatility. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Limitations]{Limitation} is permanent and always in effect unless \n    changed with an Advance as noted below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each limitation placed upon the power reduces its total @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} cost by\n    one (to a minimum of 1).

A success makes 500 gp worth of progress toward its completion, and a raise makes 1,000 gp progress.</p>\n<p>If the roll is failed, no progress is made on that item but the crafter may try again the following week. A Critical Failure destroys the item and all the materials required to create it!.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>Arrows, sling stones, bolts, or other types of ammunition are enchanted in batches of 12 at a time. If it can be recovered, each projectile has a 50% chance of remaining intact once fired.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p>A character can create any of the items listed in this book if she has the Artificer Edge (page 77), Downtime (page 148), the item to be enchanted, access to a workshop, and any spells and materials listed in the item’s Craft entry.</p>\n<p><strong>The Item: </strong>Only items of quality craftsmanship are typically given permanent enchantments. Armor, shields, weapons, and other permanent items must be of masterwork quality (page 108). additional cost, but other permanent items Potions, scrolls, and wands have no should be exceptional examples of their type, and cost 50% more than usual.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>The artificer must have any powers and materials listed in the item’s Craft entry. Materials are precious gems, metals, powders, oils, or other rare components represented by the listed gold value listed (typically half the item’s value if purchased from others).</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop: </strong>A simple workshop allows a crafter to work on a single item at a time. A standard workshop allows him to work on two, and a grand workshop allows the creation of up to three items at a time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">EXAMPLE: EzREN's Gift</h2>\n<p>Ezren the wizard wants to craft slippers of spider climbing for Merisiel the rogue. He has access to a standard workshop and can create two things at once, so he decides to make a potion of healing at the same time.</p>\n<p>The slippers have a Craft cost of 2,400. The potion’s crafting cost is 150. Ezren has wall walker (a requirement for the slippers) and gathers 2,550 gp worth of other materials.</p>\n<p>After a week’s work, he rolls and gets a success. That’s 500 gp worth of progress toward their creation. Now he rolls for the potion of healing. He’s successful, and since its cost is less than 500 gp, it’s finished and ready to use.</p>\n<p>Ezren continues on the slippers the next week and gets a raise on his roll. That’s a total of 1,500 gp progress. The third and fourth weeks he gets another success, giving him another 1,000 gp worth of progress.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Warding]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</strong> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

They also add 2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} rolls also related to stonework or mechanical work.</li>\n<li><strong>Tough:</strong> Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a d6 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} instead of a d4. This increases maximum @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} to d12+1. Their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength} is considered one die type higher for armor and worn gear (not weapons) and when determining Encumbrance.

If she already has an Arcane Background, she doesn’t get new Power Points, she must share her existing pool with all her Arcane Backgrounds. Otherwise, she also gets the Power Points listed for the class.</p>\n<p>Power Edges apply to all a character’s applicable powers, but Class Edge abilities apply only to spells provided by that class.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The following setting rules apply to <em>all</em> forms of Arcane Backgrounds in the <cite> Savage Eberron</cite> setting. Unless a change is noted below, the normal rules apply.</p>\n<h3>Detecting Magic</h3>\n<p>In the magically-charged world of Eberron, any character with an Arcane Background can sense magical or divine auras within 5” (10 yards), unless they are magically concealed. This is an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Actions]{action}.</p>\n<p>Detecting magic at a greater range or gaining specific information requires the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{detect arcana}</em> spell, which can also be used to reveal items or beings protected by <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{conceal magic}</em>.</p>\n<p>Identifying magic items requires an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} roll for everyday items like healing potions. More obscure items require an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} roll.</p>\n<h3>Using Magic</h3>\n<p>A character activates a power by picking a target within Range and making an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll. Failure means the power doesn’t activate. Success means the power activates and consumes all the Power Points allocated to it, even if it misses the target (such as with bolt), or the defender resists. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} has additional effects noted in the particular power description.</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash: </strong>A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} when activating a power is called Backlash. It causes a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} and all currently active powers instantly terminate.</p>\n<h3>CASTING REQUIREMENTS</h3>\n<p>A character must be able to see his target and cannot be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound} or silenced.</p>\n<h3>MAINTAINING POWERS</h3>\n<p>When a power ends, the caster can spend one Power Point to extend it by its base Duration. If a power’s Duration is five rounds, for example, it can be maintained for another five rounds for 1 Power Point.</p>\n<p>Maintenance is per target but ignores other Power Modifiers, so renewing <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost Trait}</em> on three allies costs 3 Power Points and extends the effect of each another five rounds.</p>\n<p>Unless a power says otherwise, the caster can terminate it as a free action.</p>\n<h3>RECHARGING</h3>\n<p>A character recovers 5 Power Points per hour spent resting.</p>\n<p>What constitutes rest is up to the GM, but generally, it means sitting, eating, tending wounds, sleeping, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Walking or riding a horse isn’t usually restful, but riding in a cushioned carriage might be.</p>\n<p>A few interruptions don’t stop a character from resting — standing watch, planning, sharpening weapons, and so on (GM’s call).</p>\n<p>An arcane hero can also spend a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny} to regain five of her Power Points. This is a free action.</p>\n<h3>POWERS AS MULTI-ACTIONS</h3>\n<p>Each power activated is its own action, and the same or different powers may be cast multiple times as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}. A wizard might start combat by invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{protection}</em> and <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Deflection]{deflection}</em>, for example, or a priest might attempt to <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Banish]{banish}</em> a spirit while invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Smite]{smite}</em> on his mace.</p>\n<h3>SHORTING</h3>\n<p>A character may cast a power with fewer Power Points than required (whether she has them or not) by increasing the difficulty of her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll.</p>\n<p>For every Power Point a character shorts, she suffers a −1 penalty to the roll. Casting a 3-point <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> with 0 Power Points, for example, inflicts a −3 penalty.</p>\n<p>Shorting is risky. If a character fails a shorted @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll, it’s considered a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure}!</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Magic and Powers</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic]{Using Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Activation]{Activation}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers Summary list}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Cantrips]{Cantrips}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{Schools of Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3> </h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":5},"cf":{"id":"temp_fsjso9rnq9","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

{"_id":"UeiJs3y8MFrNRv1Z","name":"Quick Encounters","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Quick Encounters</h1>\n\n  <p>\n    Sometimes the Game Master may want to quickly sum up an encounter rather\n    than track every action round by round. \"Quick Encounters\" resolve these\n    kinds of situations with good collaborative storytelling, tension, and risk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use Quick Encounters when\n    you're pressed for time, the group isn't as interested in tactical fights,\n    or they do something the GM isn't prepared for, like infiltrating an enemy\n    compound she hasn't yet detailed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters make a skill roll based on the type\n    of encounter and their goal and interpret the results narratively with the\n    Game Master.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Encounter Types</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    No @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards} are dealt in a Quick Encounter. Instead, the GM describes\n    the scene, and then the players agree on a general plan and what their\n    characters will do to resolve the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once all the players state their intent, they pick the skill that best\n    represents their actions during the encounter and roll. Here are some common\n    examples:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Combat:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, arcane skill.</li>\n    <li>\n      <span class=\"list-heading\">Crisis:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} (to calm bystanders), @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair}.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Heist:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery}.</li>\n    <li>\n      <span class=\"list-heading\">Mission:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting},\n      @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}.\n    </li>\n    <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Trek:</span> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival}.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Modifiers:</strong> The GM should assign modifiers based on the\n    situation. If the heroes greatly outnumber their opposition, pursue much\n    slower prey, have prior experience with the obstacles in their path, or\n    special equipment to deal with hazards, the roll might be made at +1 to +4.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Very difficult encounters, such as powerful foes (relative to the party),\n    faster prey, or extreme conditions inflict a −1 to −4 penalty.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Turn Order &amp; Critical Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    Players can go in whatever order they want in a Quick Encounter. This might\n    be important if some of their actions are dependent on someone else's. In a\n    heist, for example, the group might depend on a smooth-talker to gather\n    information about the target's security before the thief attempts to break\n    in. Similarly, a battle commander might need to send a scout across enemy\n    lines before sending in a team to sabotage the enemy's war engine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Resolve these kinds of actions in the order that makes sense, and allow\n    those who come after to change their own plans as the situation changes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a critical task is failed, the GM must decide if it stops the encounter\n    or simply complicates it (perhaps inflicting a penalty to everyone else's\n    roll). In the heist example above, for example, maybe the charmer gets the\n    information but tips off someone who adds extra sentries, inflicting a −2\n    penalty to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} rolls. Likewise, the scout might find the war\n    engine's location but the enemy moves the device shortly thereafter, adding\n    the need for additional reconnaissance for the team of saboteurs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These kinds of complications might also mean resolving the encounter in\n    multiple stages instead of one roll as the heroes must react to the changing\n    circumstances (see <strong>Staged Encounters,</strong> below).\n  </p>\n  <h3>Staged Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    Quick Encounters are typically a single die roll followed by some narration\n    between the GM and the players. But some encounters might need additional\n    rounds to better reflect the results or any new information or events that\n    come to light.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the heist to break into a wizard's tower and steal a powerful occult\n    artifact goes badly, for example, the next stage might become a crisis when\n    the tower suddenly bursts into supernatural flames. That might then lead to\n    a combat encounter as an artifact in the wizard's study breaks and releases\n    an angry djinn!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The beauty of staged encounters is their ability to handle complex problems\n    when the constraints of time or larger narrative require a speedy\n    resolution.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Encounter Results</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Once each player has determined her skill and any modifiers, she rolls the\n    dice and works with the Game Master to narrate the details based on the\n    total, the situation, and the other players' actions.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Dangerous Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    If a character fails his roll in a dangerous situation he takes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wound} (or\n    d4 Wounds with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). If he's the driver of a vehicle, it\n    takes a Wound (or d4 with a Critical Failure). Wounds may be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Soak Rolls]{Soaked} as\n    usual.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Success means the hero emerges with only <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} means he escapes unscathed.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Nonlethal Encounters</h3>\n  <p>\n    If the encounter isn't physically dangerous, failure means the hero doesn't\n    contribute to the party's overall success somehow. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means\n    she suffers social stigma, loses or breaks a piece of vital equipment, is\n    positively identified, or gets the wrong information. This likely means\n    moving on to a second stage of the encounter as she deals with the fallout\n    of her errors.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Success &amp; Failure</h3>\n  <p>\n    In general, narration and individual actions determine the success or\n    failure of an encounter. If the smooth-talker can't learn the habits of the\n    sentries, for example, and the GM decides this fact shuts down the operation\n    rather than complicating it, the encounter fails. In other words, let the\n    story tell the tale.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In a more dynamic situation such as combat, assume the group \"wins\" if there\n    are at least as many total successes (one for each success and raise) as\n    there are player characters. They get the information, drive off their foes,\n    complete the mission, or avert (or escape) the crisis. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} rolls\n    <em>don't</em> count as successes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If there are fewer successes than player characters, they fail. Specifics\n    are up to the Game Master, but this might mean the party has to fall back or\n    retreat from their foes, their prey escapes, they don't get the object or\n    information they sought, they survive the crisis but can't save most of the\n    bystanders, and so on.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If they can try again, the GM should \"reset\" the encounter with the new\n    narrative so the group has to come up with a new plan. And of course, their\n    foes are likely on to them now!\n  </p>\n  <h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3>\n  <p>\n    Use the rules for <strong>Ammo &amp; Power Points</strong> under <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mass Battles]{Mass Battles}</strong> for combat encounters if desired.  Otherwise the player and GM can just decide what resources were consumed in the encounter.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"example\">Example: Night on the prowl</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Our heroes must break into a nobleman's library, steal an ancient book, and stop an evil conspiracy that threatens all of Eberron.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The group decides to play out the break-in as a Quick Encounter. The rogue\n    plans to use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to break into the library, take the manuscript, then\n    escape out the back. The bard supports her with a diversionary recital in the town square.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM decides the rogue's Thievery roll is at −2 to get into the library.\n    The bard gets a success with his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}. He adds +1 to his\n    friend's roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The rogue manages a single success, but since there are two player characters and the rules say they need at least as many successes as there are characters, they fail.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM says three of the nobleman's guards are alerted by the pair's\n    actions. The heroes can continue if they want, but the encounter is now more\n    difficult (−2). The GM also says it's now a Dangerous Encounter as the\n    guards are armed and nervous.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With the fate of Eberron at stake, the party agrees to press on. The rogue\n    now uses @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} to avoid the guards. The bard disguises himself and knocks\n    on the door, pretending to be lost! The GM tells the bard to use Performance\n    for this Support roll. He rolls a 21! Both characters are successful, so the\n    ancient manuscript is secured!\n  </p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_coxsqc2solv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"V9hOYSuQ0f2ECPN2","name":"Half-orc","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Half-orc</h1>\n<p>Thousands of years beforc humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs of Khorvaire</h3>\n<p>With the rise ofthe dragonmarked House Tharashk, ores and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-ores. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a \"simpleton from the swamps.\"</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk.

{"_id":"VrjXvee8KFg6e8G6","name":"Hobgoblin","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Hobgoblin</h1>\n<p>The goblinoid species-goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p>\n<h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</strong> Hobgoblin eyes are accustomed to the dark of Khyber.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p>\n<p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p>\n<h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>\n<p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p>\n<p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption.

In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p>\n<h3>The Marguul</h3>\n<p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p>\n<p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</strong> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li>\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

A high attribute allows one to increase a skill faster and opens up options to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges} that greatly differentiate two characters with the same skill.</p>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes and has five points with which to improve them.</p>\n<p><strong>Agility</strong> is a measure of a character’s nimbleness, dexterity, and general coordination.</p>\n<p><strong>Smarts</strong> measures raw intelligence, mental acuity, and how fast a heroine thinks on her feet. It’s used to resist certain types of mental and social attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit</strong> is self-confidence, backbone, and willpower. It’s used to resist social and supernatural attacks as well as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fear]{fear}.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> is physical power and fitness. It’s also used as the basis of a warrior’s damage in hand-to-hand combat, and to determine how much he can wear or carry.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigor</strong> represents an individual’s endurance, resistance to disease, poison, or toxins, and how much physical damage heroes can take before they can’t go on.

Sneaking through dry leaves might subtract 2 from the Stealth roll, for example, while spotting someone in the dark uses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]{Illumination} penalty. Don’t apply the same modifier to both rolls, however.

This is an\n    action, and the effect must be based on one of the character’s existing\n    powers. A sorcerer could use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em> with a \n    fire @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trapping} to light a\n    campfire, for example. A druid could use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> to make vines\n    dance to entertain a group of children. A wizard can use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Sound/Silence]{sound}</em> to\n    ring a bell calling a servant to his study.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Success means the desired effect occurs. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise}\n    has an additional narrative impact of some kind— the candle glows brightly, the vines dance in perfect\n    synchronicity, or the bell rings loud and pure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Failure causes the spell to fail without effect. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}\n    causes the spell to backfire, which requires the caster to lose 1 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points}\n    (or suffer @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} if the caster has no Power Points). Critical Failure also\n    causes an embarrassment or minor mishap of some sort— an animated broom\n    carelessly knocks a jar of ink onto the floor, a conjured flame lights a\n    book on fire, or the power makes an embarrassing sound or smell.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A successfully cast cantrip’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Duration]{Duration} is the same as the power it’s based\n    on and may be maintained by spending Power Points as usual.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM has the final say on what a cantrip can do, but the effect must not\n    replace a power or cause damage (at least directly). It can be used to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Test}\n    or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}, or grant a +1 bonus on a subsequent roll in the same encounter.\n    For example, if the bard uses a cantrip to impress the children of\n    Sandpoint, the GM might give him +1 to a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll later on if he\n    talks to their parents or someone else who witnessed the kindness.\n  </p>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/halfwizard.webp\" />\n  </div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vv8zdhdw0l","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

technology. Spellcasters specialize in certain forms of that technology, while artificers tinker with its fundamental workings. Artificers understand magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing facility with magic items and constructs, and in many ways, they keep the magical world of Eberron running.</p>\n<p>Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.</p>\n<h3>ARCANE SCIENCE</h3>\n<p>In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.</p>\n<p>During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations.</p>\n<h3>SEEKERS OF NEW LORE</h3>\n<p>Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.</p>\n<p>This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Artificers craft, invent, and tinker with their inventions. All your powers are produced by inventions that are crafted using various tools. When creating an artificer, pick at least one kind of tool set that the artificer works with; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies} for potions and ungents, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools} for general tinkering, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Warforged Repair Kit]{warforged repair kit} if they work strictly with warforged, or another artisan tool kit that makes sense.</p>\n<p>In general, it's assumed an artificer is constantly working and tinker on their inventions during downtime. Perhaps before bed, in the morning, or during meals. It should be assumed the inventor takes at least an hour a day preparing items that might be used. If the artificer can't perform this tinkering, or does not have their tools, she can't use her powers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Burst]{burst}</em> with a poison effect, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.</p>\n<p>Artificers take pride in their custom inventions, often giving them creative names to differentiate them from other artificers. Such as \"Elenna's Miraculous Healing Ungent\" or \"Mending Spider\". You should make sure to do the same for your powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onator]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a cleric simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the cleric has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

A simple failure means the evening ends with\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>. A Critical Failure bears\n    more serious consequences. The GM might break the action down to an actual\n    encounter (which might be an ambush!). The hero might run afoul of the law,\n    come back with two levels of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from Bumps &amp; Bruises, or her\n    questions might trigger a deadly reaction from a more powerful enemy!\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"example\">Example: Savage Measures</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Amiri the barbarian needs to locate a town official held for ransom by\n    nefarious bandits. Her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} is better than her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, and she\n    has the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Menacing]{Menacing} Edge, which adds +2 to Intimidation rolls.

They dare, aspire, and risk it all to be a hero--or a villain!</p>\n    <p>They have two special abilities in the game:</p>\n    \n    <ul>\n        <li>Wild Cards can take three @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wounds} before they’re \n            @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated}.</li>\n        <li>Wild Cards roll a Wild Die (usually a d6) along with their skill or attribute die when making Trait rolls and \n        take the highest of the two as their total.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Trait Rolls</h2>\n\n    <p>To make a skill or attribute “check” or “roll,” simply roll the die assigned to it. If the result is a 4 or better (the “Target Number” or TN), the action is successful. \n        For example, if a character’s Strength is a d6, he rolls a six-sided die. On a 4 or better, he’s successful.</p>\n    <p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Circumstances modify the die roll, such as shooting at something far away or finding a well-hidden clue. \n        Some things, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranged Attacks]{ranged attacks}, have standard modifiers. It’s up to the GM to determine any modifiers for more subjective tasks, \n        such as spotting an ambush or eavesdropping on a conversation through a door.</p>\n    <p>In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks in the mud, is made at +2. A difficult task, such as finding tracks by torchlight, is made at −2. \n        A very difficult task, such as finding tracks in a rainstorm, is made at −4.</p>\n    <p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> When a character rolls multiple dice, such as when firing two arrows with the \n        @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rapid Shot]{Rapid Shot} Edge, check each die separately.</p>\n\n    <h3>The Wild Die</h3>\n    <p>Extras roll a single die when making a Trait roll. \n        @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} roll an extra d6 and take the highest of \n        their Trait die or the “Wild Die.” Both of these dice can Ace (see below).</p>\n\n    <p><strong>One Wild Die Per Action:</strong> When Wild Cards roll multiple dice for a single action, they roll only one Wild Die. \n        It may replace a Trait die or be ignored--it never adds another action or attack to the roll.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A fighter has the <em><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy}</strong></em> Edge. \n        He rolls an extra Fighting die when making a melee attack along with a Wild Die. Only two of his dice can cause hits since the Wild Die can only replace a die, \n        not add another attack.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Aces</h3>\n    <p>All Trait and damage rolls in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are open-ended. \n        That means that when you roll the highest number possible on a die (a 6 on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you get to roll that die again and add it to the total. \n        This is called an “Ace.” Any modifiers to the die roll should be tacked on after adding up an Aced roll.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        <em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A rogue attempts to leap a dangerous ice chasm. She’s a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} \n        with a d8 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, so she rolls a d8 and a d6 and takes the highest result. \n        In this case, both dice Ace (8 on the d8 and 6 on the d6). She rolls the d8 again and gets a 4 for a total of 12 on the d8. \n        She rolls the d6 again and gets another 6, followed by a 2—that’s a total of 14 on the Wild Die. The wily rogue leaps the chasm with ease! \n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Raises</h3>\n    <p>Sometimes it’s important to know just how successful a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} was. \n        Every 4 points over the Target Number is called a “raise.” If your hero needs a 4 to shoot an opponent and rolls an 11, he hits with a raise. \n        Figure raises after adjusting for any modifiers.\n    </p>\n    <p>A raise always provides an additional effect of some sort, such as bonus damage when attacking or a benefit determined by the GM for other rolls.</p>\n\n    <h3>Opposed Rolls</h3>\n    <p>Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. The attacker gets a Trait total, then the defender attempts to beat it.</p>\n    <p>The exact skills or attributes used in a contest are specified in each circumstance, or the GM can decide what makes the most sense. \n        If two characters try to pull something from each other’s hands, for example, they make opposed Strength rolls. \n        Sneaking up on someone is a Stealth roll opposed by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} (which is detailed in the Stealth skill description @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{here}).</p>\n    <p>The acting character in an opposed roll always makes the Trait total first (including spending any <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies}</strong>), \n        and must get at least a basic success (TN 4) or he fails. The defender rolls next and must <em>meet</em> or <em>exceed</em> the first character’s result or the attacker wins.\n    </p>\n    <p>The winner also uses the opponent’s total for purposes of determining raise effects.</p>\n\n    <h3>Critical Failures</h3>\n    <p>A Critical Failure occurs when a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} rolls a 1 on both the skill die and Wild Die of a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll}. \n        The attempt automatically fails and something bad happens--a weapon is dropped or gets stuck, the attack hits a friend, the vehicle crashes, spells misfire \n        (see <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]{Backlash}</strong>), and so on.</p>\n    <p>Critical Failures cannot be rerolled by any means, even with <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies}</strong>.</p>\n    <p><strong>Extras and Critical Failures:</strong> If an Extra rolls a 1 on a Trait check <em>and it’s important to know if it’s a Critical Failure</em>, \n        such as when casting a spell, roll a d6. On a 1, it’s a Critical Failure. Otherwise it’s just a normal failure.</p>\n    <p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> Some abilities allow characters to roll multiple Trait dice, such as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy} Edge or \n        firing a weapon with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rate of Fire]{Rate of Fire} higher than 1. A Critical Failure with multiple dice occurs when more than half the die results are a natural 1. \n        If the character is a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}, the Wild Die <em>must</em> be a 1 as well.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> \n        A fighter with the Frenzy Edge rolls two Fighting dice and one Wild Die. If two or more of the dice come up 1s, including the Wild Die, it’s a Critical Failure.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Unskilled Attempts</h3>\n    <p>If a character doesn’t have a skill for an action he’s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.The Wild Die]{Wild Die} if a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) \n        and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n    <p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as repairing a steam engine or piloting an airship.</p>\n\n    <h3>Reroll</h3>\n    <p>Some Edges or abilities allow a character to reroll Traits (as long as they’re not a \n        @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). \n        To do so, roll <em>all</em> the dice again and get a new total. You may keep any set you like <em>unless</em> you roll a Critical Failure. This ends all rerolls immediately \n        and becomes the result of the attempt--that’s the risk one takes in pushing the limits!</p>\n    <p>Multiple rerolls may be granted from different @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies}, or other abilities.</p>\n\n    <h3>Group Rolls</h3>\n    <p>When the GM wants to make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} for a group of Extras with like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Traits}, \n        roll one Trait die as usual along with a Wild Die and treat this as the group’s result. This gives a decent average without making rolls for every individual.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        <em><strong>Example:</strong></em> \n        A group of soldiers attempts to pass by an enemy encampment. The GM rolls their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} die (a d6) and a Wild Die and takes the best of the two as the soldiers’ total.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Bennies</h2>\n    <p>Every now and then, dice rolls may not work in your favor. That’s why <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> gives players a little control over their hero’s fate.</p>\n\n    <h3>Player Character Bennies</h3>\n    <p>Players start each game session with three “Bennies” (American slang for “benefits”), represented by poker chips, gaming stones, the official Bennies we make for all of our games, \n        or other tokens that signify a little bit of good luck or fate. Bennies are discarded at the end of each session--use them or lose them!</p>\n    <p><strong>Combat:</strong> If a session ends in the middle of combat or other dramatic event, wait until it’s resolved in the next session before giving out new Bennies.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>GM Rewards:</strong> Bennies are earned during the game in two ways:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <span class=\"list-heading\">Awards:</span> The Game Master should occasionally reward players for clever actions, roleplaying their character (especially any @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrances}), or \n            great feats of heroism.<br />She can also award players a Benny for telling a great story in character, delivering a fantastic line that makes everyone laugh, \n            or creating an emotional moment.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> When a player character draws a Joker during combat, <em>all</em> player characters receive a Benny! If the players get both Jokers \n            everyone gets <em>two</em> Bennies!\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Game Master Bennies</h3>\n    <p>Game Masters start each session with a pool of one Benny per player character. These may be used by any of her characters (including non-Wild Cards!).</p>\n    <p>The GM’s Wild Cards also have Bennies of their own, a base of three modified by their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrances}. They can use these or any of the Bennies in the common pool\n        as the GM wishes.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> Anytime the villains draw a Joker, put one Benny in their general pool and give another to each enemy \n            @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Using Bennies</h3>\n    <p>Bennies may be spent at any appropriate time and don’t incur any sort of penalty. They may only be used for your own character.</p>\n    <p>Here are the ways players can use Bennies.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll a Trait:</span> Bennies grant a hero a reroll on <em>any</em> Trait (see <strong>Rerolls,</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{here}).</li>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover from Shaken:</span> This is instant and may be done at any time, even interrupting another’s actions if desired. See Shaken @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{here}.</li>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover Power Points:</span> A character with an Arcane Background, Mystic Powers, or any other ability that grants @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} can \n            spend a Benny as a free action to recover five Power Points.</li>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Soak Rolls:</span> Bennies can be used to prevent @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wounds]{Wounds} or recover from being Shaken.\n        </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Draw a New Action Card:</span> When the game is in rounds, a character can spend a Benny to get a new \n            <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Action Cards (Initiative)]{Action Cards}</strong>. \n            This occurs after all cards are dealt and@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrances} like \n            @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Hesitant]{Hesitant} are resolved. <em>Then</em> players or \n            the GM may spend Bennies for an additional card as many times as they like and take their choice of all their draws. Edges like Quick or Level Headed <em>do not</em> apply to \n            these additional cards drawn with Bennies. This continues until everyone (including the GM) passes. Then the round begins and no further cards may be drawn.</li>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll <span>Damage:</span></span> You may spend a Benny to reroll damage. Include any additional dice you may have gained for a raise on the attack roll.</li>\n        <li><span class=\"list-heading\">Influence the Story:</span> This one is entirely up to the Game Master, who may allow a character to spend a Benny to find an additional clue if you’re stuck, \n            come up with some mundane but needed item, or push a nonplayer character into being a bit more agreeable.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        <em><strong>Example:</strong></em> The party is adrift on a storm-tossed sea. None of the characters purchased navigational equipment, \n        but @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Harsk]{Harsk} the ranger had been aiding their doomed captain through the previous encounters. Harsk's player asks the Game Master if he might have been given his\n         own compass and maps while aiding the captain, and might still have them in his bag. The GM agrees—for a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny}. \n         Harsk suddenly remembers the tools in his pack and turns the boat toward shore.</p>\n\n    <aside class=\"sidebar\">\n        <h1>Awarding Bennies</h1>\n        <p>It takes a few games to figure out how many @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies} you should award players during a session. In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, \n            especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn’t distracting the flow of the game), toss the player a Benny. \n            When players roleplay a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrance}, reward them. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p>\n        <p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, \n            players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the rogue <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. \n            There’s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but the character is the <em>rogue</em> and wants to prove it to the rest of the party.\n        </p>\n        <p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That’s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that \n            got them to this point. <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The “currency” of these chances are \n            those Bennies.\n        </p>\n        <p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded \n            for roleplaying their Hindrances the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they’re gained. That’s a fantastic pace. \n            It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some critical resource management for the final showdown.\n        </p>\n        <p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group. Then you’ll know what’s right for you and your friends.</p>\n    </aside>\n\n    <h2>Conviction</h2>\n    <p>Conviction is a special award granted when a character experiences a great and meaningful victory; or a painful and catastrophic misfortune. \n        Either drives the hero to increase her efforts, giving her inner strength she can draw on in the most desperate situations.</p>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/sorrowful-regret.webp\" style=\"padding:1%\" />\n    </div>\n    <p>Like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies}, players should receive a physical token of some sort to note their Conviction. \n        The tokens can be spent at any time to add a d6 to all the character’s Trait and damage totals until the beginning of her next turn. \n        This die can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}, and its result is added to the final total.</p>\n    <p>Conviction tokens don't stack, but the bonus may be maintained from round to round by spending a Benny at the start of the character's turn. \n        Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p>\n    <p>Conviction tokens aren’t Bennies and can’t be used as such. They <em>are</em> kept between sessions, however, and a hero can have more than one \n        Conviction token at a time.</p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>Refresh:</strong> A hero may also spend Conviction to trigger or refresh abilities that are usually only usable once per session, day, encounter, \n        and so on, even if they’ve already been used.\n    </p>\n\n\n    <h2 class=\"example\">Example: Tragedy &amp; Triumph</h2>\n\n    <p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Seelah]{Seelah} the paladin of Iomedae and her companions signed on to escort a caravan from Turtleback Ferry to Sandpoint. Over the course of the journey, they made friends with \n        the caravanners. Seelah became particularly close with a young girl she thought of as a daughter, Julia.</p>\n    <p>Then tragedy struck. A savage and brutal band of ogres descended from the hills and attacked the caravan. Seelah and her friends tore into the ogres with savage ferocity,\n         but when the dust settled, Julia was found dead.</p>\n    <p>Given her close relationship with the girl, the Game Master decides Seelah's player gains Conviction. \n        The paladin burns with rage at the murderous ogres and chastises herself for failing to protect her friend.</p>\n    <p>Later on, the party corners the ogres' chief in his hilltop fortress. Seelah personally defeats the brute in single combat and avenges Julia's death. \n        The Game Master decides the paladin's triumph is also worthy of Conviction.\n    </p> \n\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/campaign-guide.webp\" />\n    </div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_tl96ca99gn","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/3.

Do you want to try a wily @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Wizard]{wizard}, a burly @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Barbarian]{barbarian}, a tricksy @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rogue]{rogue}, or some original idea you’ve come up with yourself? The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p>\n<p>For the world of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, take a close look at the Class Edges subsection in Setting Edges @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{here}. These special abilities form the foundation of the typical player character types found in Eberron. Keep these in mind as you follow the rest of these steps so you can build toward those if you want to play a traditional Eberron-style hero.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry</h2>\n<p>This core rule book comes with seven recommended ancestries to use when creating player characters. See ancestries for more info @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Ancestries]{here}.</p>\n<h2>Hindrances</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p>\n<p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{attribute or skill} points, take @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p>\n<p>A Major @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p>\n<p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li>\n<li>Choose an Edge</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Gain another skill point, or</li>\n<li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>\n<p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p>\n<h3>Attributes</h3>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Traits}).</p>\n<p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges}.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless an ancestral ability, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edge}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional character points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses, in the list starting in the Skills subsection in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Traits} for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Ancestries]{Ancestries} start with a d6 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p>\n<h3>Derived Statistics</h3>\n<p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{Combat}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{cause harm} (explained later in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules}).</p>\n<p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{Vigor}, plus @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso. Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}, above.</p>\n<h2>Edges</h2>\n<p>Attributes and skills are a character’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges}.</p>\n<p>In <cite>Pathfinder for Savage Worlds</cite>, every character starts with a Class Edge for free. The character must qualify for the Edge as usual. (If a player doesn’t want to take a Class Edge, she may take a free Background or Professional Edge she qualifies for instead.)</p>\n<p>Characters get additional Edges by taking @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrances}, from racial abilities (such as Humans’ Adaptability), or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Advancement]{Advances} once play begins.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive list of Edges for use in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is available @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{here}.</p>\n<h2>Gear</h2>\n<p>Player characters have 300 gold pieces (or “gp”) to purchase any of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Personal Weapons]{weapons}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{armor}, and adventuring gear presented in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Gear]{the Gear Chapter}.</p>\n<p>This might represent everything the character owns or it may represent only “adventuring” gear, with the hero’s more mundane belongings stored at a home or elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp')\" src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp\" />\n<p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you see fit. Ask yourself why she’s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game? Why did she join the Pathfinders?</p>\n<p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p>\n<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p>\n<h3>Deities and alignment</h3>\n<p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p>\n<p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Game Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.8 Hindrance Summaries]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your GM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p>\n<p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges} section.</p>\n<div>\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Character creation summary</h1>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

{"_id":"r1TYWhlyGeNUcC8c","name":"Downtime","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Downtime</h1>\n  <p>\n    Adventurers often have time between their epic quests. Some might spend it\n    practicing their sword fighting techniques or enchanting magic items. Others\n    may pray to their gods, try to earn a few coins in town, spend time with\n    their friends, or aid locals in need.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> When the party has at least a week between adventures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Each player chooses one of the activities below and gains its benefits.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Personal Time</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    When the Game Master decides there’s Downtime of at least a week, you can\n    choose one of the following activities. Each provides a benefit of some\n    sort, from financial rewards to limited but valuable skill bonuses. Narrate\n    what your hero is doing then follow the instructions under each activity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Unless an option says otherwise, its effect may only be gained once regardless of how long the downtime lasts.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Carouse</h3>\n  <p>\n    Carousing characters spend their time socializing with friends, making new\n    ones, or cementing relationships with their contacts. This usually involves\n    considerable cost and time spent at local restaurants and taverns.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    During her Downtime, the character spends 50gp in food, drink, and\n    entertainment.

Taking a week to enjoy the fruits of one’s labors grants the character Conviction.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Earn</h3>\n  <p>\n    The hero earns currency in some way. Perhaps he takes on odd jobs, kills\n    rats in the local tavern, or even \"procures\" it from the local\n    thieves' guild!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The hero must make a relevant skill roll to earn her reward — @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} for\n    scoundrels, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} for Mercenaries, \"@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} for entertainers, etc. Use\n    an appropriate attribute for more mundane jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means the character doesn't make any money and\n    embarrasses herself somehow.

{"_id":"t7cEySUJEeGkcuOn","name":"Allies","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n  <h1 class=\"wide\">Allies</h1>\n  <p>\n    Allies play a big part in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> games. They serve\n    as troops under your hero’s command in war, loyal retainers serving\n    strongholds, or fellow fighters in glorious rebellions against oppression.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use these rules to help keep track\n    of the party’s followers and give them a little extra personality to play\n    off of as well.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Basics:</strong> Players create, control, and track their own followers and nonplayer character allies.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Using Allies</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Keeping up with allies in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is simple. Just download the Ally Sheet from our website and fill in the blanks.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Allied @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} are divided up among all the players to control. This is a\n    very important part of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> because our adventures\n    often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal\n    retainers, and the game is designed to handle them quickly and easily. It’s\n    also designed for the players to control them — not the Game Master.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    It doesn’t matter whether the <em>characters</em> control the allies, only\n    that the <em>players</em> do. This keeps everyone involved in the action\n    even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes running large combats much\n    easier and more fun for everyone. Of course the GM can always take charge of\n    Extras when the need arises, but with good roleplayers this is rarely\n    necessary.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Allied Personalities</h3>\n  <p>\n    You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the\n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Allied Personalities]{Allied Personalities}</strong> table. Jot down the keyword on the\n    Ally Sheet so you and your Game Master have a little insight into each\n    particular ally’s character.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Consider these general impressions with no particular game effect. They help\n    both the player and GM decide just how an ally might react in a given\n    situation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a party of adventurers tasks a retainer with keeping watch, it's helpful to know which ones are Observant and which ones are Lazy!\n  </p>\n\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n      <col></col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"4\">Allied Personalties</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading left\">d20</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">d20</th>\n        <th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Treacherous</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">11</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Crude</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Cruel</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">12</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Agile</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Old</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">13</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Observant</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>4</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Happy</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">14</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Clueless</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Experience</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">15</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Mysterious</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>6</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Gung-Ho</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">16</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Creative</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>7</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Lazy</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">17</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Artistic</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>8</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Sneaky</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">18</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Fearless</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>9</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Bright</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">19</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Cowardly</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>10</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Young</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">20</td>\n        <td class=\"centered\">Heroic</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <h3>Allies &amp; Advancement</h3>\n  <p>\n    Allies can improve their abilities as well.

This makes for\n    dramatic situations and realistic logistical problems while eliminating the\n    bookkeeping.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The GM can always decide otherwise, of course. Perhaps the troops are told\n    to fight with hand weapons instead of their bows and crossbows, or they\n    don’t get to fire off more than a couple of shots before the fight is over.\n  </p>\n\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p144_figure_collage.webp\" />\n  </div>\n\n  <h2>Typical Allies</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Here are a few typical archetypes you might use for your\n    <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Fill in any additional @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Trait Summaries]{skills} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.9 Edge Summaries]{Edges}\n    as you see fit. A group of rangers, for example, should have the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival}\n    skill, while cavalrymen should have @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Riding]{Riding}.

{"_id":"tRQ7DEVQtsBO0YVq","name":"Eneko","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Eneko</h1>\n<p>The Eneko of Skyarn are distant descendants of ogres and half-giants. As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of Sarlona. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p>\n<h3>Free People</h3>\n<p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p>\n<p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of Sarlona and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3>\n<p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of Sarlona's native humans and giant explorers from Xen'drik. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of Xen'drik flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of Xen'drik. Riedrans and less trusting Syrk humans claim the cult of Karrak is a convenient front for the practice of dark magic.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Eneko are natural strong.

{"_id":"uHQdzY3vE0C0kcWa","name":"Random Traps","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h2>Random Traps</h2>\n<p>Draw two cards from the Action Deck whenever you need a trap on the fly. These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p>\n<p>The GM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p>\n<h3>First Card</h3>\n<p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated.

Unless a character has @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{running} hero rolls at –2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists. The hero may halt his movement if he spots a trap (advisable if it's right in front of him).</p>\n<p><strong>Disarming: </strong>Disarming a detected trap requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] roll and takes a complete round (no other actions possible, including movement).

Ranged attacks use the standard range brackets for the type of missile launched. Whatever projectile is launched, range is calculated as normal.

Once activated, they must be reset in order to work again.

Due to the confines of most corridors or doorways, a maximum of two people can combine their Strength in a Cooperative roll to lift a portcullis.</p>\n<p>*** Alternately, a pit may drop the victims into a lower level of the “dungeon” rather than a small hole, thus separating the party. Another version could be a chute, which drops the victim into a cell or monster’s lair on a lower level but without inflicting any damage.</p>\n<p>**** One spell of the GM’s choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Random Trap Encountered</h2>\n<p>Aelric Olafsunu is exploring a ruined temple when the GM decides to place a trap in his path. The GM draws two cards. He gets a 3 of Hearts and the King of Diamonds.</p>\n<p>The 3H tells the GM that there is a +1 bonus to the Notice roll to spot the trap (indicated by the 3) and a –1 modifier to disarm it (indicated by the Hearts). The trap is fairly complex, but not very well disguised. Unfortunately, Aelric isn't looking out for traps and walks straight onto it. The GM decides it is a pressure plate mechanism.</p>\n<p>As this occurs outside of combat, Aelric rolls his Notice to avoid Surprise. He adds +1 from the first card's value, and scores 8. The GM tells Aelric he hears an audible click as his foot hits the floor and deals him an action card. Aelric declares he wants to move clear of the square he is on. Before he can do this, however, the trap tries to interrupt him.</p>\n<p>The trap has a fixed d10 Agility and rolls a 9. Aelric rolls his Agility and gets a lousy 5. Aelric has been hit by a falling lump of masonry (as determined by the King value of the second card). He suffers 2d8 damage (determined by the Diamonds).</p>\n<p>Note that although the trap scored a raise over Aelric's Agility total, this was not an attack roll and so it does not deal +1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>Aelric suffers 11 damage, enough to cause him a wound.

After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p>\n<p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory—villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p>\n<p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Everything living eventually dies. However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p>\n<p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend—it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Rassilon.</p>\n<p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Rassilon and the more benefits he gains.</p>\n<p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p>\n<h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3>\n<p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory. </p>\n<h2>Gaining Glory</h2>\n<p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p>\n<p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Additional Glory Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":7},"cf":{"id":"temp_rv4q29jrhjs","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"vVXTXDS2kIVprTCL","name":"Half-elf","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Half-elf</h1>\n<p>From the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sham, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h3>Khorvar</h3>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Detection]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Storm]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.

They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.</p>\n<p>But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often apopear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.</p>\n<p>While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? First of all, aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.</p>\n<p>It takes time for a character to learn to control their mark, and in time people may be hurt. If an aberrant mark grants <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, the person who carries it might have severely burned or even killed a loved one. Imagine having the power to cast charm person but being unable to control it and having people you care about suddenly becoming slavishly devoted to you. All of these factors have led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous, that their marks drive them crazy or turn them into sociopaths. These are things that can happen; people have a right to be afraid. But it is possible for an aberrant to learn to control their mark and to endure the flaw.</p>\n<h3>War of the Mark</h3>\n<p>An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarked heirs just need to concentrate on their dragonmark to activate the powers of their dragonmark. They do not need their hands free or speak.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>All trappings of the powers from aberrant dragonmarks should reflect the general destructive and often painful qualities of the dragonmark.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"wl2uXpMiroMYZIiI","name":"Fixed Glory Awards","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Fixed Glory Awards</h1>\n<p>Fixed Glory awards cover lesser deeds not played out (such as events during long periods of downtime), killing smaller number of foes during an adventure (they do slowly add up over time), or rewards for which there are many witnesses (battles or rescues). These are in addition to any Glory gained above.</p>\n<p>GM’s are encouraged to devise their own modifiers for things like concluding peace treaties or founding new mercantile routes that benefit a large population. Although notable deeds, the rewards for these types of endeavor should not be overly high—few people will remember who signed a peace treaty, but you can bet they’ll recall a hero who risked his life to venture into the heavily guarded camp of the enemy commander and kill him in an epic duel.</p>\n<h2>ACHIEVE RANK</h2>\n<p>Even without performing major heroic deeds, a hero can become famous through his collective lesser deeds. Such rewards are typical of the examples above, especially the slaying of lesser foes.</p>\n<p>These are wrapped into a single +5 Glory bonus gained when a hero achieves a new Rank. It is possible, though rare, for a hero to reach Legendary status with no additional Glory—he has performed many deeds, but none stand out as truly heroic.</p>\n<h2>Mass Battles</h2>\n<p>War is a terrible thing and something sane men avoid, but it can also grow and break reputations.</p>\n<p>Use the table below whenever the characters are involved in a fight using the Mass Battle rules. Whereas skirmishes are commonplace, true mass battles remain rare events. Hence, all Glory modifiers are fixed.</p>\n<table class=\"table gear-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Mass Battle Glory Table</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Reason</th>\n<td class=\"table-column-header\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Size</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smallest army had hundreds of troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smallest army had thousands of troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smallest army had more than 10,000 troops</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Enemy</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hated rival of your nation</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+/–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Undead Army</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+/–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Victory</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enemy had less tokens or was equal</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>For each token the enemy had above yours</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Defeat</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enemy had more tokens or was equal</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>For each token less your enemy had</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">–3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Personal Heroics</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Two raises on Heroes in Mass Battles rolls</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"table-column-header table-subheader-center\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"table-subheader-center-wrapper table-subheader-center-content\">Commander</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You commanded the army</td>\n<td style=\"width:20%\">x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Character Roll:</strong> Scoring a double raise is more than just a die result. It represents a major event within a battle, such as slaying an enemy commander or slaughtering so many foes a battalion breaks.</p>\n<p>However, the modifier only applies if the number of enemy tokens was less than or equal to your army’s tokens at the time (slaying an enemy commander when you have a +3 bonus is nowhere near as heroic as when you have a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Commander: </strong>A hero who commands an army gains greater Glory than his troops for victory, but also suffers more ignominy if he loses the field. Take the final Glory modifier and double it to see what the hero earned.</p>\n<p><strong>Defeat:</strong> Defeat is never easy to live with, but the ignominy is far worse if you outnumbered your foe. For each token you outnumbered your enemy at the start of a battle you suffer a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Forces: </strong>Certain races are more despised than others. To qualify for the bonus, the specific enemy must account for more than 75% of the enemy army’s troop strength.</p>\n<p>Add the modifier if the heroes won, and subtract it if they lost (a defeat by a hated foe usually means the enemy will grow more confident and thus pose a greater danger in the future).</p>\n<p><strong>Size: </strong>Huge armies are rare in Khorvaire now the Last War is over, and thus while any battle earns Glory, the more participants there are the greater the tale told.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory: </strong>Everybody loves a winner. The greater the size of the enemy army, the more reward is earned. For each token your enemy’s army was larger than yours when battle commenced, the hero earns a +2 Glory bonus.</p>\n<h2>RESCUE</h2>\n<p>Even if the heroes’ tale of how they killed a hundred orcs doesn’t earn them any immediate Glory, having prisoners recount the tale of their rescue quickly causes word to spread.</p>\n<p>Important NPCs must be famous, powerful, and named. A merchant, wizard, priest, minor noble, or similar is worth +1 Glory. Saving a count or a skilled spellcaster is worth +3. Rescuing a prince, king, or truly powerful spellcaster gains the hero +5 Glory.</p>\n<p>For groups of lesser NPCs, rescuing ten or so is worth +1 Glory, a few tens +2, and a hundred or more +3. Saving a lone villager from an orc tribe is brave, but not enough to be retold by skalds.</p>\n<p>Rescue doesn’t have to mean entering a prison and breaking captives out. Liberating a village beset by frostreavers, for instance, counts as a rescue. If the rescue involves a Mass Battle rather than tabletop action, the party is deserving of the Mass Battle rewards as well.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-columns-title\">Additional Glory Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_rv4q29jrhjs","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

Failure means the power doesn’t activate. The caster spends one @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Point} \n    regardless of any Edges such as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Channeling]{Channeling}, unless the ability specifically says it reduces the minimum cost to 0.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Success means the power activates and consumes all the Power Points\n    allocated to it, even if it misses the target (such as with <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>),\n    or the defender resists. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} has additional effects noted in the\n    particular power description.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Backlash:</strong> A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} when activating a power is\n    called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]{Backlash}. It causes a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} and all currently active\n    powers instantly terminate.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Casting Requirements</h3>\n  <p>\n    A character must be able to see his target and cannot be\n    \n    <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound}</strong> or silenced.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Maintaining Powers</h3>\n  <p>\n    When a power ends, the caster can spend one @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Point} \n    to extend it by its base @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Duration]{Duration}. If a power’s Duration is five rounds, for example, it can be\n    maintained for another five rounds for 1 Power Point.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Maintenance is per target but ignores other @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}, \n    so renewing<em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost Trait}</em> on three allies costs 3 Power Points and\n    extends the effect of each another five rounds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Unless a power says otherwise, the caster can terminate it as a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action}.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Stacking Powers</h3>\n  <p>\n    Powers don't stack beyond their maximum benefit or drawback. This\n    includes effects from magic items that specifically use those powers. A ring\n    that simply says it increases Strength a die type does so even if the\n    wearer's Strength is currently increased by\n    <em>boost Trait</em>(Strength), for example. If the same ring said it\n    boosts Strength a die type, however, it would only stack with the actual\n    spell or other items up to the power's maximum (two die types).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Powers that target different Traits or abilities, such as\n    <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost/lower Trait}</em>, are considered separate powers in this context.\n    Strength may only be increased up to two die types by <em>boost Trait</em>,\n    for example, but Strength and Fighting could both be boosted up to two die\n    types as each one is a separate Trait. Similarly, a sorcerer could cast\n    <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{protection}</em> (melee) on an ally who's already benefiting from a\n    ring of <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Ring of Protection, Minor]{protection}</em> (ranged).\n  </p>\n  <h3>Recharging</h3>\n  <p>A character recovers 5 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} per hour spent resting.</p>\n  <p>\n    What constitutes rest is up to the GM, but generally, it means sitting,\n    eating, tending wounds, sleeping, and avoiding any strenuous activity.\n    Walking or riding a horse isn’t usually restful, but riding in a cushioned\n    carriage might be.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A few interruptions don’t stop a character from resting— standing watch,\n    planning, sharpening weapons, and so on (GM’s call).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    An arcane hero can also spend a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Benny} to regain five Power Points. This is a\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action}.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Powers As Multi-Actions</h3>\n  <p>\n    Each power activated is its own action, and the same or dif­ferent\n    powers may be cast multiple times as a <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}</strong>. \n    A wizard might start combat by invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Protection]{protection}</em> and\n    <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Deflection]{deflection}</em>, for example, or a priest might attempt to\n    <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Banish]{banish}</em> a spirit while invoking <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Smite]{smite}</em> on his mace.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Shorting</h3>\n  <p>\n    A character may cast a power with <em>fewer</em> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points}\n    than required (whether she has them or not) by increasing the difficulty of her arcane\n    skill roll (If there is no skill roll, as with Mystic Powers, the character\n    cannot short the power).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    For every Power Point a character shorts, she suffers a −1 penalty to the\n    roll. Casting a 3-point <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> with 0 Power Points, for example,\n    inflicts a −3 penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shorting]{Shorting} is risky.

She might also\n      deal the players’ cards face up and the villains face down to increase the\n      players’ tension and uncertainty!\n    </p>\n    <p>At the start of each round:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Deal each @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} an Action Card (plus any extra cards for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Edges]{Edges}).\n        @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Allies]{Allies} under a player’s control act on his Action Card.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Groups of nonplayer characters and creatures, such as all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Zombie, Human]{zombies}, all\n        @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Dog/wolf]{wolves}, and so on, should share an Action Card so they act together. This\n        breaks each group up a bit for dramatic purposes and game balance and\n        keeps things easy for the Game Master to manage.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Shuffle:</strong> Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker\n      was dealt.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Large Groups:</strong> In very large groups or time-sensitive games,\n      the Game Master can deal a single card per side (heroes and villains). On\n      the heroes’ turn, simply start at one end of the group and work quickly\n      around. This speeds things up if that’s more important than varying\n      initiative order. If one or more characters have @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed} or \n      @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, let\n      that apply to the draw (but only once).\n    </p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{See full rules here}</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_aeejh0xnzv6","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/3.

{"_id":"xeDF5hVR3YYg3qD0","name":"Halfling","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Halfling</h1>\n<p>The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p>\n<h3>Talenta Halflings</h3>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p>\n<h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Healing]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Hospitality]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p>\n<p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Hospitality]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Healing]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Athletic: </strong>Halflings are nimble beings.

Half-giants, for the most part, retain human sensibilities. They are curious, interested in cooperation and communication, and have a general tendency toward kindness. (Half-Giants are from Sarlona and Xen’drik, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of Sarlona are descendants of ancient giant explorers from Xen'drik. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the Xen'drik titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p>\n<p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p>\n<h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3>\n<p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over Sarlona, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In Adar, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Cumbersome]{Cumbersome}: </strong>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures.
