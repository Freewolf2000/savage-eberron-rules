The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked orcs work extensively with humans and half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Brutish Size: </strong>Orcs are naturally strong.

Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h3>The Beast Within</h3>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h3>Similiar and Diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Yet to Come</h3>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Keen Senses: </strong>Shifters have heighted senses. They begin with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} skill. This increases their maximum @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision: </strong>Shifters have the sight of their beastial ancestors who have hunted in the night andtheir eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Illumination]{Dim or Dark illumination} (but not Pitch Darkness).</li>\n<li><strong>Shifting (Minor Shape Change): </strong>This ability allows a shifter to tap into his lycanthropic heritage. At character creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting is a free action and lasts 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{wound penalty}. When the shifting ends, the shifter must wait 4 hours before shifting again or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} when the second shifting ends. This level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from shifting. If the shifter uses this ability again during the recovery time, it inflicts another level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} that requires an additional 4 hours of recovery time.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide:</strong> The skin of beasthide shifters harden, providing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]{Armor} +4.</li>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk: </strong>The limbs, hands, and feet of cliffwalk shifters become stronger, allowing cliffwalk shifters to add +2 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} (climbing) rolls, and climb at their full @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace}.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight:</strong> Dreamsight shifters' instincts and awareness become heightened, granting them the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Beast Friend]{beast friend}</em> power. The power affects animals of Size +1 or smaller as well as swarms of Small size. Its effects only last while shifting rather than the power's normal duration.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute: </strong>Gorebrute shifters manifest powerful horns that can inflict @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d6 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons} in Savage Worlds Adventure Edition core rules).</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth: </strong>The face of a longtooth shifter distorts, growing a canine muzzle full of sharp teeth that cause @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Longtooth are also particularly fierce and agressive. They start with a d4 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw: </strong>The claws on the hands of razorclaw shifters grow and can be used to make attacks dealing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength}+d4 damage (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons}). Razorclaw shifters respect little other than physical power. They get a +1 bonus to all @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride:&nbsp;</strong>The legs of swiftstride shifters elongate and they balance on the balls of their feet. Their base @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} increases by 2 and their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{running die} increases a die type.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing: </strong>The arms of swiftwing shifters grow leather flaps of skin similar to a bat's wings, granting the ability to fly at a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} of 6 per round, and \"run\" for extra movement as usual. Maneuvering uses the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} skill. These wings can be targeted, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Entangled} by foes.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive: </strong>Truedive shifters grow fins and webs of skin between their toes and fingers. They become aquatic creatures that cannot drown in water, can move their full @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace} when @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{swimming}.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt: </strong>Wildhunt shifters' sense of smell becomes more sensitive, providing a +1 bonus to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival]{Survival} rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide: </strong>A winterhide shifter gains a +8 bonus to resist the negative effects of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cold]{cold} environment. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Cold]{Cold} damage is also reduced by 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;\"><img src=\"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/shifter.webp\" alt=\"Fierce Shifter warrior\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/shifter.webp","_id":"5rtZ49kGZ5OhyiJf"}

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for providing taxes and military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. It was acknowledged that all power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. Throughout Galifar, the nobility remained the foundation of the united kingdom. Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service. Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the nobles didn&rsquo;t administer justice, but it was their duty to maintain the system, appointing justices and maintaining the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and as life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners&mdash;initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, it remained the case that the majority of property was associated with a noble&rsquo;s domain, and that it was the local lord who appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to the count, the count to their duke, the duke to the prince, the prince to the king.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Common Knowledge, Intimidation, Persuasion, Traditions</p>\n<p><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Aristocract, Charismatic, House Scion, Rich, Filthy Rich</p>\n<p><strong>Social Edges:</strong> Connections</p>","_id":"5xOf0PUdv3G7kGkx"}

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Warding </em>appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dwarven Resilience:</strong> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p>\n<h3>Bound to Spirits</h3>\n<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p>\n<h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3>\n<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dual Mind: </strong>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of Sarlona. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p>\n<h3>Free People</h3>\n<p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p>\n<p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of Sarlona and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3>\n<p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of Sarlona's native humans and giant explorers from Xen'drik. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of Xen'drik flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of Xen'drik.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p>\n<p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-races.aVHntifcJ9GmX4Y1]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.125em;\">Elves of the Five Nations</span></h3>\n<p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p>\n<p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p>\n<p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p>\n<h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Shadow</em> first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>Mark of Shadow </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings.</p>\n<h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3>\n<p>For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p>\n<p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan&mdash;live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Elves are graceful and agile.

Half-giants, for the most part, retain human sensibilities. They are curious, interested in cooperation and communication, and have a general tendency toward kindness. (Half-Giants are from Sarlona and Xen&rsquo;drik, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of Sarlona are descendants of ancient giant explorers from Xen'drik. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the Xen'drik titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p>\n<p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p>\n<h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3>\n<p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over Sarlona, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"&mdash;a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In Adar, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Cumbersome: </strong>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures.

They gain a +4 bonus to resist the effects of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Heat]{heat} and fire. Damage from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Heat]{heat} and fire is also reduced by 4.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Brute:</strong> Half-giants have natural core strength and fitness over coordination and flexibility. They treat @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} as linked to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Agility} for purposes of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Advancement}. The character may also resist Athletics @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Tests} with Strength if she chooses. Finally, half-giants increase the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Short Range} of any thrown item by +1. Double that for the adjusted @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Medium Range}, and double again for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Long Range}. If a thrown item&rsquo;s Range is 3/6/12, for example, a half-giant's @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Range]{Range} is 4/8/16.</li>\n<li><strong>@Item[IsbekHb4py8znJkY]{Outsider (Minor)}:</strong> Most other races are put off by half-giants due to their abnormally large size.

This increases their maximum @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} to d12+1.</li>\n<li><strong>Stomp:</strong> With a forceful stomp of their foot, half-giants can create a wave of trembling earth. With a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics} roll, targets caught within a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Blast Templates]{Cone Template} originating from the half-giant&rsquo;s step are knocked @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.prone]{Prone}; with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise}, they are also @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Shaken}.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;\"><img src=\"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/half-giant.webp\" alt=\"Half-giant smith showing off his work.\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-rules/assets/art/half-giant.webp","_id":"Oczw1fpUPAcZ6E6W"}

Magic, both light and dark, flows through everything. The study and use of it has happpened by mystical beings such as dragons and Overlords, since the birth of the World ro present times. Much of this study and use has gone into pooling the energy into items of power.</p>\n<h3>Detecting Magic Items</h3>\n<p>Unless a magic item is \"always on\" and has a visible effect (such as a sword with a fire trapping) or produces an obvious effect when experimented with (such as a ring of invisibility making the wearer unseen the moment he slips it on), it can be difficult to tell mundane items from magical ones.</p>\n<p>An @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} roll can be made to decern that an item is in fact magical. Alternately <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal]{Detect (with Arcana trapping)}</em> reveals that an object is magical. Neither option identifies specific powers or benefits within an object.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Identifying Powers of Magical Items</h3>\n<p>There are two methods for determining what powers reside within an item. First, an arcane spellcaster can deduce the powers within an item simply through study. How long it takes is up to you, but a few minutes for a potion (given some basic testing equipment or a more dangerous taste test) and an hour for other items is usually enough.</p>\n<p>Second, <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Object Reading]{Object Reading}</em> will reveal the powers of any object the spellcaster is touching when he casts the spell. This would be seperate from the casting to determine if the item is in fact magical, and means a mage might need to cast it twice (once to detect magic and once to scrutinize).</p>\n<h3>Attuning</h3>\n<p>A hero who wishes to wield a magica item and benefit from it's power must first attune himself. Attunement can only happen after knowledge of the items powers and benefits has been discerned.</p>\n<p>In game terms, the adventurer must spend a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} to access the magic item's abilities and bonuses. If another character wishes to use the item, he must spend a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} to access its abilities as well. No @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny}, no magical powers.</p>\n<p>An adventurer who cannot use the device for some reason, cannot learn the device's powers and does not \"waste\" a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{benny} trying. A ring that can only be used by a follower of the Silver Flame, for instance, remains unusable to a warrior who follows the Cults of the Dragon Below.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.125em;\">Kinds of Magical items</span></h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Alchemical Devices:</strong>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Alchemical devices are magical creations. All he must do to actually use the power it contains is follow any instructions, such as drink a beneficial potion, point a wand at a foe, or read a scroll (unless he is Illiterate).</span> &nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Artificer Items:</strong> These magical items grant @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Edges} or bonuses to Skills or Damage. Artificer items require no activation roll to use any of the powers contained in the item. They grant the user a flat bonus to the appropiate skill. The user receives the bonus whenever he makes the skill roll. For example, a warrior need only swing his longsword to receive any bonus to his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Fighting} roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Minor Artifacts:</strong> Artifacts always require an activation roll using the relic&rsquo;s arcane skill. These items have a limited reserve of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points}&nbsp;and using them is a conscious decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Major Artifacts:</strong> These magical items come in two varieties&mdash;passive and active. Passive artifacts function continually regardless of the user&rsquo;s wishes. While they may require an action to use, such as donning a ring of invisibility, they do not require an arcane skill roll. Active items are artifacts which only function when required, such as a wand of fireballs. In these cases, an appropriate skill roll is required. Most wands, for example, require a Shooting roll. All relics, regardless of type, are considered \"always on\" because they require no Power Points. A cloak of invisibility conceals the wearer so long as it is worn, and a wand of fireballs can spew fiery death round after round.</li>\n<li><strong>True Relics: </strong>Relics are the most powerful magic items known. They are unique items, possessed of fabulous, often dangerous, power far in excess of those found in standard magical items. All true relics have a purpose. This may be as simple as destroying the races of giants or more complex, such as releasing an overlord, or bringing greater glory to the Dhakaani Empire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Items as Wild Cards</h3>\n<p>Magic items of any sort are considered Wild Cards, and so get a Wild Die when activating.</p>\n<p>If a non-Wild card picks up a magic item, he does get a Wild Die.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p>\n<p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes.

Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p>\n<p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling&rsquo;s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Among the&nbsp;<em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as&nbsp;<em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p>\n<h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Language]{Language}: </strong>Hobgoblins start with a d8 in&nbsp;@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Languages]{Goblin}<span style=\"color: #191813;\">.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Low Light Vision: </strong>Hobgoblin eyes have become accustomed to the darkness in Khyber.

To make your hero, download a Savage Worlds character sheet from our website at <a title=\"Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Inc.\" href=\"http://www.peginc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>www.peginc.com</strong></a> and follow the steps below</p>\n<h2>CONCEPT</h2>\n<p>Published Savage Settings often come with both character ideas and pregenerated &ldquo;Archetypes.&rdquo; You can play these as-is or use them to spark your own ideas.</p>\n<p>You might play an iconic gunslinger in <a title=\"Deadlands: The Weird West\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/store/deadlands-the-weird-west-core-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Deadlands: The Weird West</em></a>, for example, or you might try something a little different and play the innocent schoolmarm destined to save the town. Look through the player&rsquo;s section of your setting or talk to the GM if it&rsquo;s a world of her own creation to see what kind of character catches your interest.</p>\n<h2>Race</h2>\n<p>Settings may feature everything from humans to strange aliens, graceful elves, or other exotic races. You can choose to play any race available in your particular setting.</p>\n<p>A number of sample races are detailed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{here}, as well as rules for players and Game Masters to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{create your own}.</p>\n<h2>HINDRANCES</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character&rsquo;s backstory.</p>\n<p>You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 points. (You can take more Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p>\n<p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also gives you additional points you can use to start with additional attribute or skill points, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}, or even money for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{gear}.</p>\n<p><strong>For 2 points you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li>\n<li>Choose an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edge}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For 1 point you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain another skill point, or</li>\n<li>Gain additional starting funds equal to twice your setting's starting amount (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TRAITS</h2>\n<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called &ldquo;@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{traits},&rdquo; and both work in exactly the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{here}).</p>\n<p>You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You&rsquo;re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12 unless a racial ability says otherwise (such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{Attribute Increase}). If it does, each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12+2.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg10_red.webp\" alt=\"An image of Red and quote 'No matter what setting she's playing, Emily's character is always 'Red'. Red takes on different aspects when she wanders different worlds,but is always strong, smart, and loyal to her friends. She's also curious...a trait that constantly seems to get her in trouble...\" />\n<h3>SKILLS</h3>\n<p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Skills in <em>Savage Worlds</em> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The Shooting skill, for example, covers all types of guns, bows, rocket launchers, and other ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{list}:<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Athletics]{Athletics}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are &ldquo;innate&rdquo; abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial ability}, Edge, or Hindrance says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it&rsquo;s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Maximums:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character&rsquo;s race starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Celestials and Guardians]{Celestials}</strong> start with a d6 in Faith, for example, which means their Faith skill may be increased to d12+1.</p>\n<h3>DERIVED STATISTICS</h3>\n<p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Movement} is explained in more detail here.</p>\n<p><strong>Parry</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn&rsquo;t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Target Number} (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>: A hero&rsquo;s default @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial abilities}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than &minus;1 or more than +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero&rsquo;s damage thres&shy;hold. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage]{Damage} rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm.</p>\n<p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero&rsquo;s Vigor, plus @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor Notes]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.</p>\n<h2>EDGES</h2>\n<p>Traits @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Attributes and skills} are a character&rsquo;s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges}. Even two legionaries in <a title=\"Weird Wars Rome\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/store/weird-wars-rome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Weird Wars Rome</em></a> with identical Traits play vastly different depending on the Edges they take. One might focus on Leadership Edges that lets him rally his fellow soldiers while another concentrates on taking out large numbers of foes at once with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Sweep]{Sweep} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy}.</p>\n<p>Characters get @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Edges]{Edges} by taking @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Races]{racial abilities} (such as <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Humans]{Humans' Adpatability})</strong>, or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Advances}</strong> once play begins.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive list of Edges is available. Your setting book likely has additional abilities specific to that world or genre as well.</p>\n<h2>GEAR</h2>\n<p>Some settings provide your hero with all the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{gear} she needs. Most simply grant a starting amount of funds you can use to purchase whatever you like from a relevant list of weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.</p>\n<p>Unless your setting book or GM says otherwise, the standard starting amount is $500. A list of common gear and weapons can be found in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{Chapter Two}.</p>\n<p>Depending on the setting, this might be everything the character owns or it may represent their &ldquo;adventuring&rdquo; gear, with their more mundane belongings stored at a home or apartment. The latter is up to the Game Master. In modern settings, most everyone should have a home, clothes, appliances, and so on. The equipment you list on your character sheet should be your character&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventuring gear&rdquo; rather than an exhaustive list of everything she owns.</p>\n<p>Players don&rsquo;t have to worry about how much they can carry in most games, but if it becomes important, see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Gear Notes]{Encumbrance}.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg11_roman.webp\" alt=\"An image of a Roman Centurion with quote 'Roman Centurion...These guys mean business!'\" />\n<h2>BACKGROUND EDGES</h2>\n<p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you care to. Ask yourself why she&rsquo;s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game?</p>\n<p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p>\n<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you&rsquo;ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you&rsquo;re playing what you want to play. There&rsquo;s no point in being the party&rsquo;s healer if that&rsquo;s not a role you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"Vdw8y4RUwX8TdO1j"}

This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p>\n<h3>A Hidden People</h3>\n<p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p>\n<p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p>\n<p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p>\n<h3>Masks and Personas</h3>\n<p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>\n<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.7Paj4Q0eBcVDFbvy]{Change Appearance}:</strong> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em>&nbsp;power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs of Khorvaire</h3>\n<p>With the rise ofthe dragonmarked House Tharashk, ores and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-ores. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a \"simpleton from the swamps.\"</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Heritage: </strong>Half-orcs may retain the strength of their orc parent or the adaptability of their human ancestry.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h3>Khorvar</h3>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>Mark of Detection </em>is found in House Medani and the <em>Mark of Storm </em>in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.</p>\n<p>With the <em>Mark of Storm</em>, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the <em>Mark of Detection</em> to offer services of personal protection.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Heritage:</strong> Half-elves may retain the grace of their elven parent or the adaptability of their human ancestry.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to Zilargo: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Scribing</em> appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Gnome Cunning:&nbsp;</strong>Gnomes are intelligent creatures.

During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries.

However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p>\n<section class=\"ridged-block-float\">\n<h3>PLAYING A VILLAIN</h3>\n<p>Not every player is going to want to play a hero, and that's fine. After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p>\n<p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory&mdash;villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p>\n<p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend&mdash;it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Rassilon.</p>\n<p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Rassilon and the more benefits he gains.</p>\n<p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p>\n<h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3>\n<p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory.</p>\n<h2>Gaining Glory</h2>\n<p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p>\n<p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p>\n<h3>VARIABLE GLORIOUS DEEDS</h3>\n<p>After each adventure, and only when the heroes return to civilization, one of the party may begin telling the tale of their epic battles and heroic deeds. The character makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.★ Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll, modified as below.</p>\n<p>The DM is always free to add positive modifiers for truly heroic actions or based on the character's weaknesses and how he overcame them. Always try to think of how the heroes' true exploits (as opposed to any extra bits they invent) sound as a tale told by skalds. This is important, as it is the listeners on Khorvaire who are effectively granting them Glory.</p>\n<p>Ideally, an extra +1 or +2 should be the maximum. For instance, slaying a dread liche is certainly worthy of praise, but that is already covered in the table. However, lopping off his head with a Called Shot as the killing blow is worth a small modifier, as it's the sort of detail found in epic poems.</p>\n<p>Likewise, a Novice party with a d6 as their highest combat skill (including arcane skills) who slay a bunch of orc warriors in melee without any assistance should be rewarded with a greater chance of fame.</p>\n<p>The DM may also opt to add penalties to reflect weaker opponents (such as unarmed or unarmored orcs) or favorable character circumstances (every hero had a dozen alchemical <em>blast</em> devices on hand).</p>\n<h3>GLORY AWARDS</h3>\n<p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p>\n<p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack&ndash;damage\" routine.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p>\n<p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a &ndash;3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p>\n<h2>Additional Glory Information</h2>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Calculating Glory]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Glory Benefits]</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Losing Glory]</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/savage-eberron-artwork/assets/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","_id":"oHGvYEelUklF3CAi"}

The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Talenta Halflings</h3>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur&mdash;like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks&mdash;centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p>\n<p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and HouseJorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Halfling's average only about four feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Language]{Language}: </strong>Halflings start with a d8 in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Languages]{Halfling}.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Pace:</strong> Halflings have short legs compared to human-sized races.

Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p>\n<p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p>\n<h3>The Marguul</h3>\n<p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p>\n<p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</strong>&nbsp;Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p>\n<h3>City Goblins</h3>\n<p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the&nbsp;<em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.
