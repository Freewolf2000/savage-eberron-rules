troubadours, song mages, are sorcerers who work their magic through the power of motion, song, poetry, and storytelling. The art is extremely ancient and found among all races, though the dragonmarked House Phiarlan maintains the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Entertainers and Artisans Guild}, and it has dominated the industry for centuries. The house trains and licenses performers, and maintains many of the grand stages. The finest schools of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan} are known as the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Organizations in House Phiarlan]{Five Demesnes}. As well as being spellcasters, bards are also storytellers and poets, able to recount epic poems and stories from memory. Some play instruments, but most simply use their voice to enthrall their audience. Their talents make them popular guests. Finding a warm place to sleep and a hot meal usually requires nothing more than a tale to entertain the host.</p>\n<p>From the ancient goblin dirge singers to the entertainers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{House Phiarlan}, many cultures embrace the bard or skald as entertainer who also serves as a historian or bearer of news, a chronicler if you will. To survive on the road, a trouper must be clever, charismatic, and versatile above all. Whether a tryst with a foe resolves by silver-tongue or adamantine blade, an adventuring bard's worth truly comes from the ability to improvise a magical talent to charm, lull, or simply assist with a nearly limitless reservoir of practical knowledge and skill. While the common trope sings of a troubadour whose magic harmonizes with some cosmic symphony, those who have traversed Khorvaire have learned that inspiration is the true magic of any bardic exhibition, regardless of the medium.</p>\n<p>Bards usually don’t end up as wandering minstrels or street performers—any expert with some training and skill can fill that role. Instead, some skalds use their magical abilities to unearth ancient lore, while others use their interpersonal skills and mystical music to advance their careers as spies, ambassadors, diplomats, and chroniclers. As such, skalds find employ as adventurers, as well as in governments and among the mercantile houses.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} produces a large number of bards, since the gnomes’ love of knowledge makes them particularly well suited to this class. In other areas, bards appear most often in the large cities and towns throughout @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane}, and (particularly) @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aundair]{Aundair}. Bards with wilder ties are found in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}, particularly among the druid sect of the Greensingers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that pervades Eberron: through music. Some bards claim that the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful tune of creation.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings} for a skald will always manifest as something with the performing arts. Song and sonic trappings would be the most common. But other trappings could include playing an instrument, dancing, a poetic verse, and anything else of the like.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

After all, when you’ve already slain a giant, who cares if you killed an orc chieftain?</p>\n<p><strong>Foes’ Toughness:</strong> Once you start talking about fighting a giant, listeners tend to forget or lose interest in the orcs you defeated in an earlier encounter. As such, only the highest @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness} of defeated foes counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Named Wild Card:</strong> No one really cares much if a hero slays a generic orc chieftain, but the slaying of Nargal the Terrible is a notable deed. Not every @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} should, or indeed can, be named. Sometimes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} orc chief is just a nameless foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Foes:</strong> As with foes’ @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}, once you begin telling how the party slew a dozen orcs in one encounter, talk of beating five or six tends to become dull to the average listener. As such, only record the greatest number of foes slain in a single encounter. Defeating three orcs in one room and eight in another equates to only eight orcs.</p>\n<p>The party size includes any allies on the heroes’ side—a party with 20 members must defeat a lot of foes at once to get noticed. Even if the heroes forget to mention their helpers, any survivors will be telling their own stories across Rassilon.</p>\n<p><strong>Single Blow:</strong> A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} killed in a single blow must have been unwounded when the killing blow was delivered. Chopping the head off a dread liche with 3 wounds is not exactly heroic.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the foe must have been aware of the party and capable of retaliation—slaughtering sleeping dragons or <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangled}</em> giants doesn’t make a good story, though the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> spell might be worth a small bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Storyteller:</strong> Although anyone can tell a story, skalds are trained in using the right words and adjusting the rhythm to keep an audience enthralled. They can turn even a mundane adventure into an epic struggle.</p>\n<h3>GLORY AWARDS</h3>\n<p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p>\n<p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack–damage\" routine.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p>\n<p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a –3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-links-title\">Additional Glory Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_lfqse89fhyg","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

{"_id":"1OqUkTn0tSLDucmw","name":"Warforged","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Warforged</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>\n<h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p>\n<h3>Warforged Personality</h3>\n<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>\n<p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Built for War:</strong> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war. Negotiations were not part of their training, and their world knowledge off of the battlefield is limited. They do not have @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} as core skills.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Composite Plating]{Composite Plating}: </strong>A warforged is covered in tough plating made of magically-treated woods and metals.

Warforged are unable to wear additional @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]{armor}.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Living Construct]{Living Construct}:</strong> Warforged are living constructs made from organic and inorganic matter and are capable of emotions and conscious thought. They do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Poison]{poison} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Disease]{disease}. Warforged also don’t need to sleep, and arcane powers can’t put them to sleep. Warforged must spend at least six hours in a relaxed state. In this state, they appear inert, but remain conscious, and they can see and hear as normal.\n<p>Wounds must be mended via the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Repair]{repair}</em> power or the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair} skill. Each attempt takes one hour per current @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Wound} level and ignores the “@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Healing]{Golden Hour}”.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Outsider (Warforged)]{Outsider (Major)}: </strong>With a history of being dedicated soldiers of war, warforged have difficulty blending into post-war Khorvaire. Most non-warforged strongly dislike the sight of warforged as they stand as living reminders of the horror that was the Last War. As such, warforged have –2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{persuasion} rolls when interacting with non-warforged and are often treated with less rights that others.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Specialized Design]{Specialized Design}:</strong> Warforged are typically designed for specific purposes. They start with a d4 in any skill based on their experiences, education, training.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using Smarts is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Schools]{Schools}</h3>\n<p>A wizard's intense studies lead him down two paths—a \"universalist\" who dabbles in all the various \"schools\" of magic, or a \"specialist\" who focuses on a school at the expense of other studies.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Specialists</strong></em> designate one favored @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{school} and two opposition @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{schools} from the list below.

For this reason, each wizard maintains a spellbook with the spells he’s translated and acquired. He studies them daily, transcribing their mystical patterns onto his mind.</p>\n<p>The link to the book is far more than rote memorization—it is an arcane bond with the power and patterns within. If a wizard doesn’t have access to his spellbook, he may continue to cast normally until the next sunset or sunrise (whichever comes first). After that, the magical imprint on his mind fades and he can no longer cast them.</p>\n<p>Wizards may only carry one active spellbook at a time. The mountains of scrolls, magical notations, and research needed to prepare another cannot be carried with the wizard and must be stored safely somewhere. It takes a week of work and 500 gp to create a replacement spellbook once the wizard has access to his magical notes.</p>\n<p>When a wizard finds a new spellbook or scroll, the spells it contains become available as choices to the wizard when he next chooses the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers} Edge. Moreover, a wizard taking the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.New Powers]{New Powers} Edge can learn a third new power, if all the new powers are learned from scrolls and spellbooks.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Mages must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Wizards are some of the most versatile casters in Eberron.

{"_id":"4FZyw9PdSQ7ZMJW2","name":"Goblin","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Goblin</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands ofyears. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p>\n<h3>City Goblins</h3>\n<p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language. Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends, while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"</p>\n<h3>Welcome to Eberron</h3>\n<p>With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. Ifyour halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Standard Languages</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Language</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Typical Speakers</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Script</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td>Citizens of Khorvaire</td>\n<td>Common</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwarven</td>\n<td>Mror Holds</td>\n<td>Dwarvish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elven</td>\n<td>Aerenal, Valenar</td>\n<td>Sylvan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td>Goblin</td>\n<td>Darguun, Droaam, Shadow Marches, monsters of Khorvaire</td>\n<td>Goblin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnomish</td>\n<td>Zilargo</td>\n<td>Dwarvish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>Talenta Plains</td>\n<td>Goblin</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Exotic Languages</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Language</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Typical Speakers</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Script</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Argon</td>\n<td>Barbarians of Argonnessen and Seren</td>\n<td>Common</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Draconic</td>\n<td>Kobolds, lizardfolk, troglodytes, dragons, arcane uses</td>\n<td>Draconic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druidic</td>\n<td>Druids, Eldeen Reaches</td>\n<td>Draconic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant</td>\n<td>Native inhabitants of Xen'drik</td>\n<td>Giant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orc</td>\n<td>Isolated orc tribes</td>\n<td>Goblin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Riedran</td>\n<td>People of Sarlona</td>\n<td>Common</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sahuagin</td>\n<td>Sahuagin, sailors</td>\n<td>Sahuagin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Khyber's Tongue</td>\n<td>Denizens of Khyber, symbionts</td>\n<td>Daelkyr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Planar Languages</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Language</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Typical Speakers</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Script</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Celestial</td>\n<td>Celestials, Archons of Shavarath, couatl, shulassukar</td>\n<td>Celestial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Daan</td>\n<td>lawful outsiders of Daanvi</td>\n<td>Daan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infernal</td>\n<td>Beings of Shavarath, Lords of Dust, tieflings</td>\n<td>Infernal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Irial</td>\n<td>Deathless, energy beings of Irian</td>\n<td>Celestial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kythric</td>\n<td>Slaadi, choatic outsiders of Kythri</td>\n<td>Daan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quori</td>\n<td>Inspired, kalashtar, quori</td>\n<td>Quori</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primordial</td>\n<td>Elementals</td>\n<td>Primordial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sylvan</td>\n<td>Dryads, eladrin, fey of Thelanis and woodland beings</td>\n<td>Sylvan</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_intbwo9s2if","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"65n5URr0MER6n0yM","name":"Kalashtar","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Kalashtar</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union ofhumanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams-spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p>\n<h3>Bound to Spirits</h3>\n<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p>\n<h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3>\n<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Dual Mind: </strong>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p>\n<p>When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p>\n<p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p>\n<h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3>\n<p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p>\n<p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member ofyour adventuring party.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Drow are graceful and agile.

/>\n<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this can dangerous and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Spellcasting using Smarts is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you’re looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you’re doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you’re a scientist.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Principles of Arcane Science}</h3>\n<p>Arcane magic involves the manipulation of vast, ambient mystical energies that permeate Eberron. These forces are largely omnipresent and invisible, not unlike gravity; they’re fundamental elements of the world, and in the course of time most cultures find some way to harness and manipulate them. Like most forms of science, there are different theories about how this science works, and specifically what force is being manipulated.</p>\n<p>You should consider what school of Arcane Science your wizard comers from and let that influence the kind of casting that your wizard accomplishes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Siberyan Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Externalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Sympathetic Magic}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Dominion Theory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Principles of Arcane Science]{Fringe Traditions}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Mages must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper.

{"_id":"9pAAJ5A3Id1qF07Z","name":"Noble","content":"<p>The highest levels of nobility are shared among the nations of Khorvaire, but other nobles exist among families of great import or strong political ties.</p>\n<p>When Galifar was founded, the Five Nations all employed forms of medieval feudalism. Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for providing taxes and military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. It was acknowledged that all power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. Throughout Galifar, the nobility remained the foundation of the united kingdom. Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service. Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the nobles didn’t administer justice, but it was their duty to maintain the system, appointing justices and maintaining the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and as life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, it remained the case that the majority of property was associated with a noble’s domain, and that it was the local lord who appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to the count, the count to their duke, the duke to the prince, the prince to the king.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Common Knowledge, Intimidation, Persuasion, Traditions</p>\n<p><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Aristocract, Charismatic, House Scion, Rich, Filthy Rich</p>\n<p><strong>Social Edges:</strong> Connections</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.zds95QdTAYavucmH"},"cf":{"id":"temp_pkglbsbzxv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p>\n<p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p>\n<h3>Masks and Personas</h3>\n<p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>\n<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</strong> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can't fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>\n<h3>The Beast Within</h3>\n<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>\n<p>A shifter's beast within is reflected by its shifting ability. Four kinds are especially common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beasthide </strong>often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtooth </strong>shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftstride </strong>are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildhunt </strong>shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These other types are also present in the shifter population</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cliffwalk </strong>often signifies apes, monkeys, or goats: expert climbers and social.</li>\n<li><strong>Dreamsight </strong>don't have a particular beast within, so much as a deep intuitive connection with all beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorebrute </strong>are born from powerful horned beasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Razorclaw </strong>are often clawed predatory animals, often feline in connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Swiftwing </strong>are flight beasts such as flying rodents and bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Truedive </strong>manifest connections to fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterhide </strong>are from creatures that dwell in cold mountain passes: stoic, tough, and often loners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>\n<h3>Similiar and Diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Yet to Come</h3>\n<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to \"always be prepared for the journey yet to come,\" and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>\n<p>Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Keen Senses: </strong>Shifters have heighted senses. They begin with a d6 @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} skill.

At character creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting is a free action and lasts 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{wound penalty}. When the shifting ends, the shifter must wait 4 hours before shifting again or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} when the second shifting ends. This level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from shifting. If the shifter uses this ability again during the recovery time, it inflicts another level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{fatigue} that requires an additional 4 hours of recovery time.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Beasthide]{Beasthide}:</strong> The skin of beasthide shifters harden, providing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Armor]{Armor} +4.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Cliffwalk]{Cliffwalk}: </strong>The limbs, hands, and feet of cliffwalk shifters become stronger, allowing cliffwalk shifters to add +2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} (climbing) rolls, and climb at their full @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{Pace}.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Dreamsight]{Dreamsight}:</strong> Dreamsight shifters' instincts and awareness become heightened, granting them the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Beast Friend]{beast friend}</em> power.

The process isn’t like the spells of a wizard or the tools of an artificer, nor is it a divine petition to a higher power. Well, not exactly. Legend recounts how the great progenitor dragon Eberron enveloped the jealous evil of Khyber in the living prison that would become the world. If arcane magic comes from the tears of Siberys above, then Druidic magic is the blood and breath of Eberron herself, granting power to those who seek to defend her and the natural order from the threats beyond.</p>\n<p>Most druids are swathed in tradition, usually initiated by a sect that teaches the secrets of this primal magic while also charging the aspirant with specific duties. While some sects are loosely aligned, each one has its own ideas as to the role their kind should play in the world.</p>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature’s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Civilization</h3>\n<p>Most druids come from the Eldeen Reaches, where their animistic religion is the dominant faith. Others are found anywhere that nature’s spirit is strong, from the craggy mountains that house the Mror Holds to the fetid swamps of the Shadow Marches. Some druids from the Eldeen Reaches espouse radical philosophies that oppose the use of “unnatural” magic and condemn the building of settlements. Most druids are more moderate in their beliefs about the proper balance of nature, magic, and civilization.</p>\n<p>You can roll on the <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore-tables.Druidic Beliefs]{Druidic Beliefs}</strong> table to see how your druid views civilization.</p>\n<h3>Druids and Sovereign Host</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the Sovereign Host is a civilized faith with shrines in the great cities of the Five Nations but a number of shrines to deities tied to nature can be found in the wilds. Balinor is the Sovereign of the Hunt, Arawai brings nature’s bounty, and the Devourer embodies its destructive power and the hunger that reclaims its waste. In Eberron, a priest of Balinor isn’t inherently required to follow one trail or the other, but the main differences between the two lay in how command of nature is granted, and the purpose for which they use it. While it’s common for the two paths to recognize one another, such respect isn’t always equal.</p>\n<p>From a philosophical perspective, a druid is an envoy of nature with a connection to the environment itself, not a servant of a higher power. By contrast, the cleric serves a higher power and holds dominion over the natural world. While druids shun such metal armaments, nature clerics usually practice combat in manmade heavy metal armors until proficient. Yet, clerics lack the primal understanding required to communicate in Druidic and to assume Wild Shape, which is a reflection of the druid’s deep connection to the natural world.</p>\n<p>Such differences lead to a deep disconnect between the typical druid and a nature worshiping cleric. The Warden of the Wood might see the priests of Balinor as an arrogant outsider, a city-dweller who believes that humanoids hold some sort of divine right over the planet, which is admittedly often the case. To the priestess of Arawai, nature is something that serves the people and her primary concern is ensuring a bountiful harvest, not driving farmers from their fields.</p>\n<p>While this is the obvious contrast, it’s possible to create a character who uses one class while following the opposite path. Perhaps you want to play a priest of Balinor but you love the idea of hunting in the form of a wolf, or you want to be Ashbound but have no interest in ever assuming a Wild Shape. While there will be the occasional disconnect, like the Ashbound cleric can’t use Wild Shape, the Balinor druid can’t turn undead, look to juxtapose these ideas to best match the story and experience you’re looking for, using backgrounds like the acolyte or outlander to cultivate the option.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Druids must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Druids interact constantly with nature, drawing all their power from it. They regularly perform various rituals while they rest or pray. They regularly tend to the natural order of things. This opens their conduits of power to the natural energies and allows them to activate powers later without begining the appeal in the moment. </p>\n<p>Druidic powers are cast through chants, talismans, and talking with nature itself. Depending on the spell, the druid may cast bones, sprinkle of ash, rubbing a talisman, beseeching the forces of nature. Trappings for the spells of druids should all include natural components or aspects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

For thousands of years, wizards, sorcerers, clerics, artificers, adepts, and magewrights have brought their magical talents to bear to solve the problems life poses. These solutions have helped humanoid society develop and thrive on every continent—particularly on Khorvaire. The result is a society suffused with magic. Skycoaches fly among the soaring towers of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn}. Blacksmiths chant spells over forges to improve the way they work.

{"_id":"IwlAzxyHDWKK3dGS","name":"Gnome","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Gnome</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3>\n<p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p>\n<p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p>\n<p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p>\n<p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p>\n<p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p>\n<h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Scribing]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p>\n<p>Today, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Diminutive:</strong> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Gnome Magic]{Gnome Magic}: </strong>Gnomes are inherently magical creatures.

{"_id":"KSBHDrReNupapVpQ","name":"Using Magic Items","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Using Magic Items</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Savage Eberron is a mythic place. Magic, both light and dark, flows through everything. The study and use of it has happpened by mystical beings such as dragons and Overlords, since the birth of the World ro present times. Much of this study and use has gone into pooling the energy into items of power.</p>\n<h3>Detecting Magic Items</h3>\n<p>In the magically-charged world of Eberron, any character with an Arcane Background can sense magical or divine auras within 5” (10 yards), unless they are magically concealed. This is an action.</p>\n<p>Detecting magic at a greater range or gaining specific information requires the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{detect arcana} spell, which can also be used to reveal items or beings protected by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{conceal magic}. </p>\n<h3>Identifying Powers of Magical Items</h3>\n<p>There are three methods for determining what powers reside within an item. First, an arcane spellcaster can deduce the powers within an item simply through study. How long it takes is up to you, but a few minutes for a potion (given some basic testing equipment or a more dangerous taste test) and an hour for other items is usually enough.</p>\n<p>Second, <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{Identify (from detect arcana)}</em> can be used to identify a magic item's powers and how they work.</p>\n<p>Third, <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Object Reading]{object reading}</em> will reveal the powers of any object the spellcaster is touching when he casts the spell. This would be seperate from the casting to determine if the item is in fact magical, and means a mage might need to cast it twice (once to detect magic and once to scrutinize).</p>\n<h3>Attuning</h3>\n<p>A hero who wishes to wield a magical item and benefit from it's power must first attune himself. Attunement can only happen after knowledge of the items powers and benefits has been discerned. The hero must then spend one hour with the item, and they are then attuned to it an may use it's powers.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Common Magic Item Rules</span></h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Active Powers are Actions:</strong> An item that requires a Trait roll is an action unless it says otherwise. Critical Failure means the user takes Fatigue (and loses a charge if the item has them).</li>\n<li><strong>Edges and Abilities:</strong> If an item grants an Edge or Monstrous Ability and the wielder already has that Edge, it grants the improved version (if there is one).</li>\n<li><strong>Minor and Major Powers:</strong> Some items grant minor or major powers as listed with the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers}. A <em>minor</em> power automatically activates with the effect of a standard success, and a <em>major</em> power activates with the effect of a raise (no Trait roll is made). Unless the item says otherwise, this is an action and the effect lasts for the power’s full Duration and cannot be maintained.</li>\n<li><strong>Stacking:</strong> If two sources would increase a Trait, use only the highest modifier (effects don’t stack). Increases to a Trait from a magic item’s effects don’t count for determining Trait Advancements. They do affect secondary statistics like Parry or Toughness, however.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Items:</strong> A character can only wear one magic item in each location (head, eyes, shoulders, neck, chest, belt, wrists, hands, feet). Putting on a second necklace or a second belt, for example, has no effect. The exception to this rule is rings. A character can wear two rings and benefit from both magical effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Enemies with Magic Items</h3>\n<p>Enemy characters and monsters equipped with enchanted and magical items have the bonuses conferred by those items built into their profiles.</p>\n<p>So an evil knight wearing plate armor enchanted with the Aegis enchantment, for example, might have a Toughness of 12(5), where the plate armor's bonus of +4 has already been increased by the Aegis enchantment's +1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-links-title\">Articles on Magic Items</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic Items]{Using Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Purchasing Magic Items]{Purchasing Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Enchantments]{Enchantments}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Crafting Magic Items]{Crafting Magic Items}</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"center vert-spacer\"><img class=\"table-figure\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/people/artificer-infusing-armor.webp\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_otr25ys05qi","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"KxFfUAb8Xj8zlzRK","name":"Elf","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Elf</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Tens of thousands ofyears ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p>\n<p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p>\n<h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p>\n<p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p>\n<p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p>\n<h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Shadow]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Shadow]{Mark of Shadow}</em><em> </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings.</p>\n<h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3>\n<p>For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p>\n<p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Agile:</strong> Elves are graceful and agile.

psionics is the art of tapping the mind’s potential. A psionic character is blessed with a form of innate ability that enables him or her to use mental power to achieve goals or perform tasks that nonpsionic characters can accomplish—if they’re even capable of doing them at all—only by using gross physical skills such as brute strength or raw agility, or by using intellect or force of will distinct from the natural power of the mind itself.</p>\n<p>Your character’s mind is an infinite metaphorical plane, where all things are possible. It may be that all characters have within them the potential for harnessing the energy of the mind, but only those who succeed in tapping into that potential can become psionic characters. A psionic character knows the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of thought and energy. Knowing the path, the psionic character walks it. Like a flare being thrown off a star, a power is manifested from a psionic character’s energy of consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Secrets of the Mind</h3>\n<p>From the duergar traditions of the Akiak dwarves to the quori techniques of the kalashtar and Inspired, psionics are strong in Sarlona. Adventurers might have no recourse but to travel to Sarlona to learn certain psionic arts. The traditions of the psychic warrior are begining to find their way to Khorvaire, but it is still very rare.</p>\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Psionic powers spring from sentient minds and are manifested through intense concentration. The psion merely needs to concentrate to manifest his inborn powers, drawing on his abilities by tapping a reservoir of mental strength. He has no need for messy material components, verbal cues, or awkward gestures.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>TRappings of psionic power are wide and varied. They can draw fire from thin air, move a boulder without touching it, catch a glimpse of the future, and communicate with others who are miles away. Force is a common trapping for psionic powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

/>\n<h2>Playing those with Innate Magic</h2>\n<p>Those with innate magic, create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories—just raw power that they direct at will. Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.</p>\n<h3>Raw Magic</h3>\n<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or ataste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So toa might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the [nner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>\n<p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on. nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>\n<h2>CASTING</h2>\n<p>Sorcerers must make gestures with at least one free hand and speak aloud various magical words at least at a whisper. If either their hands are bound or they are prevented from speaking, they cannot cast their spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>Wielding magic that is innate and from some untold force, sorcerers can wield very versatile magic. There are no limitations on the kinds of trappings that can be utilized by a sorcerer.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

This ties up their own Power Points, however, and such creations are temporary.</p>\n<p>With enough time and resources, however, an artificer can create more permanent items of wonder, and best of all he doesn’t have to tie up his own Power Points in the process!</p>\n<h2>THE CRAFTING PROCESS</h2>\n<p>After each week spent Crafting, the artificer makes an Occult roll for each item he’s working on. A success makes 500 gp worth of progress toward its completion, and a raise makes 1,000 gp progress.</p>\n<p>If the roll is failed, no progress is made on that item but the crafter may try again the following week. A Critical Failure destroys the item and all the materials required to create it!.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>Arrows, sling stones, bolts, or other types of ammunition are enchanted in batches of 12 at a time. If it can be recovered, each projectile has a 50% chance of remaining intact once fired.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>\n<p>A character can create any of the items listed in this book if she has the Artificer Edge (page 77), Downtime (page 148), the item to be enchanted, access to a workshop, and any spells and materials listed in the item’s Craft entry.</p>\n<p><strong>The Item: </strong>Only items of quality craftsmanship are typically given permanent enchantments. Armor, shields, weapons, and other permanent items must be of masterwork quality (page 108). additional cost, but other permanent items Potions, scrolls, and wands have no should be exceptional examples of their type, and cost 50% more than usual.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>The artificer must have any powers and materials listed in the item’s Craft entry. Materials are precious gems, metals, powders, oils, or other rare components represented by the listed gold value listed (typically half the item’s value if purchased from others).</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop: </strong>A simple workshop allows a crafter to work on a single item at a time. A standard workshop allows him to work on two, and a grand workshop allows the creation of up to three items at a time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">EXAMPLE: EzREN's Gift</h2>\n<p>Ezren the wizard wants to craft slippers of spider climbing for Merisiel the rogue. He has access to a standard workshop and can create two things at once, so he decides to make a potion of healing at the same time.</p>\n<p>The slippers have a Craft cost of 2,400. The potion’s crafting cost is 150. Ezren has wall walker (a requirement for the slippers) and gathers 2,550 gp worth of other materials.</p>\n<p>After a week’s work, he rolls and gets a success. That’s 500 gp worth of progress toward their creation. Now he rolls for the potion of healing. He’s successful, and since its cost is less than 500 gp, it’s finished and ready to use.</p>\n<p>Ezren continues on the slippers the next week and gets a raise on his roll. That’s a total of 1,500 gp progress. The third and fourth weeks he gets another success, giving him another 1,000 gp worth of progress. The slippers are finished and he gifts them to his friend.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-links-title\">Articles on Magic Items</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic Items]{Using Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Purchasing Magic Items]{Purchasing Magic Items}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Enchantments]{Enchantments}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Crafting Magic Items]{Crafting Magic Items}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_otr25ys05qi","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/4.

{"_id":"PeSNTMqtRrY96Kwg","name":"Dwarf","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Dwarf</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3>\n<p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p>\n<p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p>\n<p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p>\n<h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p>\n<p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p>\n<h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Warding]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</strong> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

They also add 2 to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} rolls also related to stonework or mechanical work.</li>\n<li><strong>Tough:</strong> Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} instead of a d4. This increases maximum @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} to d12+1.

When a hero reaches a multiple of 20 Glory he must immediately pick one benefit from the list below, meeting any requirements. Some heroes may opt to acquire Followers or become leaders of men and build a personal army. Others might use their fame to gain valuable connections or become better combatants, while others may prefer to rely on their reputation to ensure a friendly welcome in civilized lands.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, benefits can be taken multiple times—the number in parentheses after the name indicates the maximum number of times the benefit may be taken. Fill in the appropriate section of the character sheet.</p>\n<p>Should Glory drop below a multiple of 20, any benefits above the character’s current Glory level are temporarily lost (unless otherwise stated) until Glory is regained. Dropping below 20 and then rising above it again does not grant the opportunity to take a new benefit—it simply allows the “lost” one to be used again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Barak the Fair</h2>\n<p><em>Dave’s character, Barak the Fair, has the Heroic Status benefit, which he took he reached 20 Glory.

Only if Barak’s Glory drops below 20, will he lose his Heroic Status as well.</em></p>\n<p><em>Later on, Barak earns +4 Glory, bringing his total to 42.

This is an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Actions]{action}.</p>\n<p>Detecting magic at a greater range or gaining specific information requires the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{detect arcana}</em> spell, which can also be used to reveal items or beings protected by <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Detect/Conceal Arcana]{conceal magic}</em>.</p>\n<p>Identifying magic items requires an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} roll for everyday items like healing potions. More obscure items require an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} roll.</p>\n<h3>Using Magic</h3>\n<p>A character activates a power by picking a target within Range and making an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} roll. Failure means the power doesn’t activate. Success means the power activates and consumes all the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points} allocated to it, even if it misses the target (such as with bolt), or the defender resists. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} has additional effects noted in the particular power description.</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash: </strong>A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} when activating a power is called Backlash. It causes a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} and all currently active powers instantly terminate.</p>\n<h3>CASTING REQUIREMENTS</h3>\n<p>A character must be able to see his target and cannot be @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bound and Entangled]{Bound} or silenced.</p>\n<h3>MAINTAINING POWERS</h3>\n<p>When a power ends, the caster can spend one @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Point} to extend it by its base Duration. If a power’s Duration is five rounds, for example, it can be maintained for another five rounds for 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Point}.</p>\n<p>Maintenance is per target but ignores other Power Modifiers, so renewing <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost Trait}</em> on three allies costs 3 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points} and extends the effect of each another five rounds.</p>\n<p>Unless a power says otherwise, the caster can terminate it as a free action.</p>\n<h3>RECHARGING</h3>\n<p>A character recovers 5 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points} per hour spent resting.</p>\n<p>What constitutes rest is up to the GM, but generally, it means sitting, eating, tending wounds, sleeping, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Walking or riding a horse isn’t usually restful, but riding in a cushioned carriage might be.</p>\n<p>A few interruptions don’t stop a character from resting — standing watch, planning, sharpening weapons, and so on (GM’s call).</p>\n<p>An arcane hero can also spend a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bennies]{Benny} to regain five of her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points}. This is a free action.</p>\n<h3>POWERS AS MULTI-ACTIONS</h3>\n<p>Each power activated is its own action, and the same or different powers may be cast multiple times as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Action}.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs of Khorvaire</h3>\n<p>With the rise ofthe dragonmarked House Tharashk, ores and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-ores. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a \"simpleton from the swamps.\"</p>\n<h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>The <em>Mark of Finding</em> appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Heritage: </strong>Half-orcs may retain the strength of their orc parent.

{"_id":"VrjXvee8KFg6e8G6","name":"Hobgoblin","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Hobgoblin</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The goblinoid species-goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p>\n<h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3>\n<p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p>\n<p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</strong> Hobgoblin eyes are accustomed to the dark of Khyber.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p>\n<p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p>\n<h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>\n<p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p>\n<p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</strong> Tieflings infernal heritage allows them to see into the darkness of Khyber.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p>\n<p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li>\n<li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li>\n<li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3>\n<p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p>\n<p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p>\n<p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world.

{"_id":"dunAw0B1Slwf1514","name":"Bugbear","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Bugbear</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands ofyears. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p>\n<h3>The Marguul</h3>\n<p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p>\n<p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3>\n<p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p>\n<p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p>\n<p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p>\n<p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</strong> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li>\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the <em>war staff</em> and <em>battle rod</em>. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it’s no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people “arcane dragoons.” If you fight your battles with with <em>assault wands</em>, <em>battle rods</em>, or <em>war staves</em>, you’re known as a “wandslinger.”</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Arcana, Fighting, Performance, Taunt, Wand magic</p>\n<p><strong>Background Edges:</strong> Ambidextrous, Arcane Background (Wand Magic), Arcane Resistance, Improved Arcane Resistance, Elan, Quick</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Edges:</strong> Dodge, Improved Dodge, Extraction, Improved Extraction, Level Headed, Improved Level Headed, Two-Fisted</p>\n<p><strong>Power Edges:</strong> Power Surge</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Edges:</strong> Humiliate, Rabble-Rouser</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.28ZrVCCrEGX0SY49"},"cf":{"id":"temp_pkglbsbzxv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

Each point represents one day’s food, water, and other supplies for each man on board, and costs 5 silver sovereigns per head. This includes fruit capable of staving off scurvy.</p>\n<p>Every 500 points of provisions takes up one cargo space.</p>\n<p>Note that provisions are not the same as “Food” that can be bought and sold at ports. Provisions are biscuits, hardtack, and water. Food is fruit, bread, grain, wine, and other “luxuries.” A cargo space worth of Food can be converted into 50 provisions in an emergency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example:</h2>\n<p><em>The Frigate Jolly Edward sets sail with twelve crew. The captain expects to be at sea for at least a month, so he needs 12 provisions for each of 30 days, or 360 provisions. He decides to play it safe and buys 500 provisions. The provisions cost 500 pieces of eight and take up one cargo space.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the ship runs out of food, the captain could convert a cargo space worth of “Food” (a commodity) to 50 provisions. This would feed his 12-man crew for about 4 days.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunger:</strong> Wild Cards suffer from starvation normally (one provision a day counts as adequate food). For the rest of the crew, make a group Vigor roll each day they have half rations (one provision for every two men). Subtract 2 if the men have less than this.</p>\n<p>Should the crew collectively reach Incapacitated state, 10% of the men perish each day from starvation.

technology. Spellcasters specialize in certain forms of that technology, while artificers tinker with its fundamental workings. Artificers understand magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing facility with magic items and constructs, and in many ways, they keep the magical world of Eberron running.</p>\n<p>Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.</p>\n<h3>ARCANE SCIENCE</h3>\n<p>In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.</p>\n<p>During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations.</p>\n<h3>SEEKERS OF NEW LORE</h3>\n<p>Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.</p>\n<p>This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Artificers craft, invent, and tinker with their inventions. All your powers are produced by inventions that are crafted using various tools. When creating an artificer, pick at least one kind of tool set that the artificer works with; @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies} for potions and ungents, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools} for general tinkering, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Warforged Repair Kit]{warforged repair kit} if they work strictly with warforged, or another artisan tool kit that makes sense.</p>\n<p>In general, it's assumed an artificer is constantly working and tinker on their inventions during downtime. Perhaps before bed, in the morning, or during meals. It should be assumed the inventor takes at least an hour a day preparing items that might be used. If the artificer can't perform this tinkering, or does not have their tools, she can't use her powers.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{healing}</em> using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Alchemist Supplies]{alchemist supplies}, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-equipment.Tinker's Tools]{tinker's tools}, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Burst]{burst}</em> with a poison effect, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.</p>\n<p>Artificers take pride in their custom inventions, often giving them creative names to differentiate them from other artificers. Such as \"Elenna's Miraculous Healing Ungent\" or \"Mending Spider\". You should make sure to do the same for your powers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can’t even read might feel @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onator]{Onatar’s} guiding hands and cast magecraft. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.</p>\n<p>Faith is about conviction. It can’t be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you’re smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn’t mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can’t think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.</p>\n<h3>Connection to Divine Power</h3>\n<p>But faith alone isn’t enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Onatar]{Onatar} actually guides all artisans or if @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Dorn]{Dol Dorn} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who’s spent decades studying texts doesn’t? People of faith usually respond that it’s because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it’s all just luck.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a cleric simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the cleric has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: “@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Dol Arrah]{Dol Arrah} smite my foe!” or “Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!” Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn’t just ask for something; they reach out and take the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it can backlash on them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings} for divine magic vary greatly depending on the faith or diety of the the clergy.

Paid crews use shares as well when figuring how to split unexpected payouts.</p>\n<p>The typical arrangement often is two shares for the ship’s “bank,” (to be used for repairs, provisions, and so on), three shares for the captain, two shares for the first mate, navigator, mages, super, and surgeon.

They salvage the cargo on board it. When the cargo is finally sold at Regalport. The Jolly Edward gains 400 galifars. So each share is worth 20 galifars.

Subtract 2 if the men have less than this.</p>\n<p>Should the crew collectively reach @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Damage Effects]{Incapacitated} state, 10% of the men perish each day from starvation.

{"_id":"tRQ7DEVQtsBO0YVq","name":"Eneko","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Eneko</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The Eneko of Skyarn are distant descendants of ogres and half-giants. As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of Sarlona. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p>\n<h3>Free People</h3>\n<p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p>\n<p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of Sarlona and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3>\n<p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of Sarlona's native humans and giant explorers from Xen'drik. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of Xen'drik flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of Xen'drik. Riedrans and less trusting Syrk humans claim the cult of Karrak is a convenient front for the practice of dark magic.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Brute Strength:</strong> Eneko are natural strong. They start with a d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

{"_id":"uHQdzY3vE0C0kcWa","name":"Random Traps","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<h2>Random Traps</h2>\n<p>Draw two cards from the Action Deck whenever you need a trap on the fly. These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p>\n<p>The GM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p>\n<h3>First Card</h3>\n<p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated. Use the suit entry of the second card on the Trap Type table below to determine the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} die for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Detecting: </strong>Detecting a trap requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll. Unless a character has @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Movement]{running} hero rolls at –2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists. The hero may halt his movement if he spots a trap (advisable if it's right in front of him).</p>\n<p><strong>Disarming: </strong>Disarming a detected trap requires a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] roll and takes a complete round (no other actions possible, including movement). On a critical failure, the trap activates and automatically affects the unfortunate hero.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Trap Difficulty Table</h2>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Value</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Detect</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Suit</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Disarm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Joker</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Joker</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2–4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Club</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5–10</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Diamond</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jack–Queen</td>\n<td>–1</td>\n<td>Heart</td>\n<td>–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>King–Ace</td>\n<td>–2</td>\n<td>Spade</td>\n<td>–2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h3>Second Card</h3>\n<p>The second card determines the exact type of trap encountered.

Draw a third card to determine the trap type. The suit of the new card indicates the Wild Die, as well as other details. Traps with a Wild Die apply it to rolls to all Trait rolls, when applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>Area: </strong>Traps usually affect a 1\" square on the battle grid. Ranged attacks use the standard range brackets for the type of missile launched. Whatever projectile is launched, range is calculated as normal. The distance listed for pits is their depth. <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{Glyph} </em>traps affect an area or operate at range as per the spell description and the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{arcane skill} die.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration: </strong>Traps are generally one-shot devices. Once activated, they must be reset in order to work again. Portcullises remain in place until lifted up.</p>\n<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> Most traps activate with little warning to the unfortunate victim. Outside of combat use the rules for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Surprise]. In combat, traps being on Hold and roll to interrupt. Traps have @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Agility} d10 for this purpose.

A second Joker indicates the trap is faulty and does not work.</p>\n<p>** Portcullis traps either have a single gate (usually to block the way the party has come and so force them forward) or drop two gates (one ahead and one behind the intruders to trap them in a small area). Due to the confines of most corridors or doorways, a maximum of two people can combine their Strength in a Cooperative roll to lift a portcullis.</p>\n<p>*** Alternately, a pit may drop the victims into a lower level of the “dungeon” rather than a small hole, thus separating the party. Another version could be a chute, which drops the victim into a cell or monster’s lair on a lower level but without inflicting any damage.</p>\n<p>**** One spell of the GM’s choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Random Trap Encountered</h2>\n<p>Aelric Olafsunu is exploring a ruined temple when the GM decides to place a trap in his path. The GM draws two cards. He gets a 3 of Hearts and the King of Diamonds.</p>\n<p>The 3H tells the GM that there is a +1 bonus to the Notice roll to spot the trap (indicated by the 3) and a –1 modifier to disarm it (indicated by the Hearts). The trap is fairly complex, but not very well disguised. Unfortunately, Aelric isn't looking out for traps and walks straight onto it. The GM decides it is a pressure plate mechanism.</p>\n<p>As this occurs outside of combat, Aelric rolls his Notice to avoid Surprise. He adds +1 from the first card's value, and scores 8. The GM tells Aelric he hears an audible click as his foot hits the floor and deals him an action card. Aelric declares he wants to move clear of the square he is on. Before he can do this, however, the trap tries to interrupt him.</p>\n<p>The trap has a fixed d10 Agility and rolls a 9. Aelric rolls his Agility and gets a lousy 5. Aelric has been hit by a falling lump of masonry (as determined by the King value of the second card). He suffers 2d8 damage (determined by the Diamonds).</p>\n<p>Note that although the trap scored a raise over Aelric's Agility total, this was not an attack roll and so it does not deal +1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>Aelric suffers 11 damage, enough to cause him a wound. He vows to be more careful as he descends deeper into the temple.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":10},"cf":{"id":"temp_5qurmfm60sv","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p>\n<p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory—villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p>\n<p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Everything living eventually dies. However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p>\n<p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend—it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Rassilon.</p>\n<p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Rassilon and the more benefits he gains.</p>\n<p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p>\n<h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3>\n<p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory. </p>\n<h2>Gaining Glory</h2>\n<p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p>\n<p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p>\n<p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p>\n<p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p>\n<h3>Khorvar</h3>\n<p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p>\n<p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p>\n<p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p>\n<h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Detection]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Storm]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.</p>\n<p>With the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Storm]{Mark of Storm} </em>, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}. operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} uses the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Detection]{Mark of Detection}</em> to offer services of personal protection.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Elven Ancestry]{Elven Ancestry}:</strong> Half-elves retain their elven ancestral connection to arcane energies.

They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.</p>\n<p>But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often apopear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.</p>\n<p>While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? First of all, aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.</p>\n<p>It takes time for a character to learn to control their mark, and in time people may be hurt. If an aberrant mark grants <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em>, the person who carries it might have severely burned or even killed a loved one. Imagine having the power to cast charm person but being unable to control it and having people you care about suddenly becoming slavishly devoted to you. All of these factors have led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous, that their marks drive them crazy or turn them into sociopaths. These are things that can happen; people have a right to be afraid. But it is possible for an aberrant to learn to control their mark and to endure the flaw.</p>\n<h3>War of the Mark</h3>\n<p>An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.</p>\n<p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p>\n<h2>Casting</h2>\n<p>Dragonmarked heirs just need to concentrate on their dragonmark to activate the powers of their dragonmark. They do not need their hands free or speak.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h2>\n<p>All trappings of the powers from aberrant dragonmarks should reflect the general destructive and often painful qualities of the dragonmark.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yqngxv6403a","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"wl2uXpMiroMYZIiI","name":"Fixed Glory Awards","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Fixed Glory Awards</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Fixed Glory awards cover lesser deeds not played out (such as events during long periods of downtime), killing smaller number of foes during an adventure (they do slowly add up over time), or rewards for which there are many witnesses (battles or rescues). These are in addition to any Glory gained above.</p>\n<p>GM’s are encouraged to devise their own modifiers for things like concluding peace treaties or founding new mercantile routes that benefit a large population. Although notable deeds, the rewards for these types of endeavor should not be overly high—few people will remember who signed a peace treaty, but you can bet they’ll recall a hero who risked his life to venture into the heavily guarded camp of the enemy commander and kill him in an epic duel.</p>\n<h2>ACHIEVE RANK</h2>\n<p>Even without performing major heroic deeds, a hero can become famous through his collective lesser deeds. Such rewards are typical of the examples above, especially the slaying of lesser foes.</p>\n<p>These are wrapped into a single +5 Glory bonus gained when a hero achieves a new Rank. It is possible, though rare, for a hero to reach Legendary status with no additional Glory—he has performed many deeds, but none stand out as truly heroic.</p>\n<h2>Mass Battles</h2>\n<p>War is a terrible thing and something sane men avoid, but it can also grow and break reputations.</p>\n<p>Use the table below whenever the characters are involved in a fight using the Mass Battle rules.

It represents a major event within a battle, such as slaying an enemy commander or slaughtering so many foes a battalion breaks.</p>\n<p>However, the modifier only applies if the number of enemy tokens was less than or equal to your army’s tokens at the time (slaying an enemy commander when you have a +3 bonus is nowhere near as heroic as when you have a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Commander: </strong>A hero who commands an army gains greater Glory than his troops for victory, but also suffers more ignominy if he loses the field. Take the final Glory modifier and double it to see what the hero earned.</p>\n<p><strong>Defeat:</strong> Defeat is never easy to live with, but the ignominy is far worse if you outnumbered your foe. For each token you outnumbered your enemy at the start of a battle you suffer a –3 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Forces: </strong>Certain races are more despised than others. To qualify for the bonus, the specific enemy must account for more than 75% of the enemy army’s troop strength.</p>\n<p>Add the modifier if the heroes won, and subtract it if they lost (a defeat by a hated foe usually means the enemy will grow more confident and thus pose a greater danger in the future).</p>\n<p><strong>Size: </strong>Huge armies are rare in Khorvaire now the Last War is over, and thus while any battle earns Glory, the more participants there are the greater the tale told.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory: </strong>Everybody loves a winner. The greater the size of the enemy army, the more reward is earned. For each token your enemy’s army was larger than yours when battle commenced, the hero earns a +2 Glory bonus.</p>\n<h2>RESCUE</h2>\n<p>Even if the heroes’ tale of how they killed a hundred orcs doesn’t earn them any immediate Glory, having prisoners recount the tale of their rescue quickly causes word to spread.</p>\n<p>Important NPCs must be famous, powerful, and named. A merchant, wizard, priest, minor noble, or similar is worth +1 Glory. Saving a count or a skilled spellcaster is worth +3. Rescuing a prince, king, or truly powerful spellcaster gains the hero +5 Glory.</p>\n<p>For groups of lesser NPCs, rescuing ten or so is worth +1 Glory, a few tens +2, and a hundred or more +3. Saving a lone villager from an orc tribe is brave, but not enough to be retold by skalds.</p>\n<p>Rescue doesn’t have to mean entering a prison and breaking captives out. Liberating a village beset by frostreavers, for instance, counts as a rescue. If the rescue involves a Mass Battle rather than tabletop action, the party is deserving of the Mass Battle rewards as well.</p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-links-title\">Additional Glory Articles</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Variable Glorious Deeds]{Variable Glorious Deeds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fixed Glory Awards]{Fixed Glory Awards}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Glory Benefits]{Glory Benefits}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Losing Glory]{Losing Glory}</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_lfqse89fhyg","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/5.

This is an action, and the effect must be based on one of the character’s existing powers. A sorcerer could use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Bolt]{bolt}</em> with a fire @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trapping} to light a campfire, for example. A druid could use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> to make vines dance to entertain a group of children. A wizard can use <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Sound/Silence]{sound}</em> to ring a bell calling a servant to his study.</p>\n<p>Success means the desired effect occurs. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} has an additional narrative impact of some kind—the candle glows brightly, the vines dance in perfect synchronicity, or the bell rings loud and pure.</p>\n<p>Failure causes the spell to fail without effect. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} causes the spell to backfire, which requires the caster to lose 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Point} (or suffer @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} if the caster has no @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points}). @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure} also causes an embarrassment or minor mishap of some sort—an animated broom carelessly knocks a jar of ink onto the floor, a conjured flame lights a book on fire, or the power makes an embarrassing sound or smell.</p>\n<p>A successfully cast cantrip’s Duration is the same as the power it’s based on and may be maintained by spending @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Power Points} as usual.</p>\n<p>The DM has the final say on what a cantrip can do, but the effect must not replace a power or cause damage (at least directly).

{"_id":"xeDF5hVR3YYg3qD0","name":"Halfling","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Halfling</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p>\n<h3>Talenta Halflings</h3>\n<p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p>\n<p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p>\n<p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p>\n<h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3>\n<p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p>\n<h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3>\n<p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Healing]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Hospitality]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p>\n<p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Hospitality]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Mark of Healing]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Athletic: </strong>Halflings are nimble beings.

Half-giants, for the most part, retain human sensibilities. They are curious, interested in cooperation and communication, and have a general tendency toward kindness. (Half-Giants are from Sarlona and Xen’drik, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of Sarlona are descendants of ancient giant explorers from Xen'drik. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the Xen'drik titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p>\n<p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p>\n<h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3>\n<p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over Sarlona, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In Adar, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p>\n<h2>Racial Abilities</h2>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-racial-abilities.Cumbersome]{Cumbersome}: </strong>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures.

These specialized groups are called schools. Any power not tied to a school of magic is considered to be a universal spell, such as <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Wish]{wish}</em>. There are eight schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation.</p>\n<p>A spell is always considered to be from its school, no matter where it comes from. <em>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{Boost Trait}</em>, for example, is a Transmutation power, whether its cast from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Background (Cleric)]{Arcane Background (Cleric)} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Background (Sorcerer)]{Arcane Background (Sorcerer)}. The GM may decide, however, that a caster's specific trappings move the power into a different school for that caster (so a GM might rule that, while a typical barrier belongs to the conjuration school, a purely magical barrier might be an evocation spell instead).</p>\n<p>Knowing the schools of magic and their effects can be instrumental in identifying magical traps, weapons, items, or auras surrounding an opponent.</p>\n<p>Here are the various schools and the powers that belong to each. Note: these lists do not affect which powers an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Background} has access to. These lists simply identify which powers are associated to each particular school and the general focus of the school of magic.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Abjuration:</strong> The abjurer uses magic against itself, specializing in defensive magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Conjuration:</strong> Conjurers focus on spells to summon magical servants or bend reality to their will.</li>\n<li><strong>Divination:</strong> Diviners are masters of remote viewing and prophesies; they use their spells to explore the world.</li>\n<li><strong>Enchantment: </strong>The enchanter uses magic to manipulate the minds and perceptions of opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>Evocation: </strong>Evokers revel in the raw power of magic; they use spells to create and destroy with equal ease.</li>\n<li><strong>Illusion: </strong>Illusionists use magic to produce confounding sights, sounds and even smells to baffle and vex their opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>Necromancy: </strong>The dread necromancer commands undead and uses the foul power of unlife against enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Transmutation: </strong>Transmuters use magic to change themselves and the world around them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"toc-links-title\">Magic and Powers</h2>\n<div class=\"toc-columns\">\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Using Magic]{Using Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Activation]{Activation}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Powers Summary List]{Powers Summary list}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Cantrips]{Cantrips}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Schools of Magic]{Schools of Magic}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trappings]{Trappings}</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">\n<h3> </h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/logo-eberron-circle-black.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4},"cf":{"id":"temp_0re3y8nenvi","path":"Savage Eberron Rules#/CF_SEP/3.
